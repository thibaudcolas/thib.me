This is not an opinion piece, just me realizing that people actually do use the stuff I put up on GitHub. And that my open-source contributions have real, tangible impact.

Today I changed my GitHub username from ThibWeb to [thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas). I had been thinking about making the switch for a while, for a bunch of reasons, and GitHub was the last holdout: this username is all over the 100+ repositories I have contributed to. It was quite a long process to update it across all of the repositories I had available locally on my computer, but nothing off the charts (Sublime Text handles search+replace on thousands of files without sweating).

The real surprise came from this search on GitHub: https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ThibWeb. The search results are packed with mentions of my open-source contributions in various projects:

- A bunch of people committing their [`smooth-scroll`](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) dependency – I wrote unit tests for this library a while ago, among other changes. Glad that helped!
- This [stronger-loop](https://github.com/dnd1/stronger-loop) NodeSchool workshop which cites [workshopper-mocha-boilerplate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workshopper-mocha-boilerplate) as an inspiration. Glad that helped too.
- Mentions of the french translations for jQuery Validate I did a while ago.
- And a lot of other things

... and here are four people who built their resume with the JSON resume theme [Eloquent](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/jsonresume-theme-eloquent) I made a few years ago, and that I used to apply to my current job at Springload:

- https://omidreyhani.github.io/
- https://luoxiaobatman.github.io/
- https://guntherjh.github.io/
- http://victorperin.ninja/resume/

Glad this helps too :)

PS: Wow! [106 PRs so far](https://github.com/thibaudcolas?tab=overview&from=2010-12-01&to=2010-12-31)
