Sharing my highlights of [DjangoCongress JP 2025](https://djangocongress.jp/), an online Django event with mixed Japanese-English content.

<!-- more -->

With time zones in the way, it was an event I could only share the very beginning and end of, having to sleep in the middle! But I really enjoyed the bits I managed to attend.

## Talks

The [program](https://djangocongress.jp/#program) had lots of different things. I personally really like to see mixed-language events like this. I only know a few words of Japanese, but I could understand a few words (mizu, neko, etc ðŸ¥²). But more importantly, the event had live subtitles and captioning! So both Japanese-language and English-language talks had English and Japanese captions.

My favorite talk was about project architectures / structures with DRF. Unfortunately the speakerâ€™s name was provided in kanji only, and I just donâ€™t have enough skills in Japanese to romaji it! But thank you é‡Žå‘‚æœ‰æˆ‘!

## Birthday

DjangoCongress were the first event in 2025 to acknowledge Djangoâ€™s 20th birthday. Django has roots in 2003, but 2005 was when the project got started as an open source endeavor named Django. In particular, July 2005 is when the code was open sourced and the website set up. November 2005 was the first official release (0.90).

It was lovely to see DjangoCongress JP organizers showcase this history during the event! In my mind the whole of 2025 is Djangoâ€™s birthday, so weâ€™ll see other events celebrating this later in the year too.

## Thank you

ðŸ«¶ I had a great time! Thank you DjangoCongress JP organizers for putting so much thought into making the event accessible for non-Japanese speakers, Iâ€™d never seen this done so well before and it was truly impressive.
