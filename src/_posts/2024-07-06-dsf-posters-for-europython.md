As a follow-up to the [accessibility team stickers](/django-accessibility-team-stickers), I designed conference roll-up posters for the Django Software Foundation at [EuroPython](https://ep2024.europython.eu/).

![Six conference banner design variations side-by-side](/images/blog/django-conference-banner-variations.png)

We tried a few different designs, attempting to reuse existing Django design assets where possible:

- Background shapes are from the djangproject.com website.
- Shades of green are from the website. Pink shades are from the pony design.
- The heart is from the website / Django Girls+.
- The pony itself is a pre-existing illustration.

The final design and the earlier variations are available on GitHub: [thibaudcolas / dsf-design-assets](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/dsf-design-assets).
