This badge reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community for all Djangonauts. Itâ€™s part of the [CHAOSS DEI Project Badging](https://badging.chaoss.community/project-badging) initiative.

Our new [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Project Statement](https://github.com/django/.github/blob/main/DEI.md) details all the ways in which we want to create an environment where everyone can participate and thrive, and complements our pre-existing [Django Community Diversity Statement](https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/). From inclusive leadership structures to Django events, we strive to ensure our community is welcoming, transparent, and supportive.

Thank you to everyone in the Django community who contributes to making our project inclusive, accessible, and welcoming ðŸ«¶. Thank you to Sarah Boyce, who led the work for us to be awarded this badge as part of . We view this milestone as part of a continuous journey for our project and community to improve, and look forward to building an even more vibrant and supportive community together.
