Nominations are open for the 2025 Django Software Foundation Board of Directors.

<!-- more -->

In 2023 we introduced a staggered term for directors. Of our 7 directors, there are 4 positions currently open, with each position serving for two years.

Decisions around the 2025 officer roles will be made during the meeting of the new board. You don’t need to specify which position you are nominating for.

As you know, the Board guides the direction of the marketing, governance and outreach activities of the Django community. We provide funding, resources, and guidance to Django events on a global level. Further we provide support to the Django community with an established Code of Conduct and make decisions and enforcement recommendations for violations. We work with our corporate and individual members to raise funds to help support our great community.

In order for our community to continue to grow and advance the Django Web framework, we need your help. The [Board of Directors](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/#board) consists of seven volunteers who are elected to two year terms. This is an excellent opportunity to help advance Django. We can’t do it without volunteers, such as yourself. Anyone including current Board members, DSF Members, or the public at large can apply to the Board. It is open to all.
