New stickers! ðŸŒˆ

<!-- more -->

![Four variations of the Django pony, displayed over light and dark backgrounds, with accessories](/images/blog/django-accessibility-team-stickers/accessibility-team-pony-variations.png).

Using the [base pony design](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/dsf-design-assets/tree/main#pony-mascot), combined with added visuals symbolizing different accessibility needs.

- The sunglasses represent visual impairments. It comes [from the Noun project](https://thenounproject.com/icon/sunglasses-6294988/) image #6294988, art by [M Syaiful Anshari](https://thenounproject.com/creator/ansharyms/).
- The cane also represents visual impairments. It comes [from OpenMoji - white cane](https://openmoji.org/library/emoji-1F9AF/).
- The wheelchair represents mobility impairments.
- The cast represents a broken leg - trying to speak to the social model of accessibility (itâ€™s not just permanent conditions).

We also considered a [sunflower hidden disability pony](https://hdsunflower.com/). That will likely make it for a future set.
