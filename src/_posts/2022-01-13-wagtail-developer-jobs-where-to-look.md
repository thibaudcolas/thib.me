Looking for a Wagtail job? Or to hire a developer? Here are good places to check.

<!-- more -->

There are more options than you might think! Wagtail being based on Django, anyone with a Django skillset will be productive with Wagtail. As such, this list is equally relevant when searching for or advertising Django developer jobs.

## Chat

This is my favourite option by far, with the #jobs channel in the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack). Our Slack workspace is very active, with #jobs being one of the most viewed channels. Using chat also makes it much simpler for people to have a conversation about a given job offer.

Here is a screenshot of the workspace’s statistics, showing 250 weekly active users:

## Newsletters

This is a good option but the lead time is high, as there are only a few ad placements available per week.

- [Django News](https://django-news.com/) – regularly includes Wagtail content.
- [PyCoder’s Weekly](https://pycoders.com/) – occasional mentions of Wagtail.

## Conferences

There are a lot of great options here, with a good number of events recurring every year.

- [Wagtail Space](https://www.wagtail.space/), and [Wagtail Space US](https://us.wagtail.space/)
- [DjangoCon Europe](https://2021.djangocon.eu/)
- [DjangoCon US](https://djangocon.us/)
- [Python Web Conference](https://2022.pythonwebconf.com/) (coming up soon!)
- [Django Day Copenhagen](https://djangoday.dk/) (also coming up soon)

## Job listings

General-purpose job sites are always worth looking at for job offers matching "Wagtail" or "Django". There are also a few specialised job boards:

- [Django jobs RSS](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/jobs/), aggregating other job boards.
- <https://djangojobs.net/>
- <https://djangogigs.com/>

## Wagtail developers

Last but not least, [Made with Wagtail developer profiles](https://madewithwagtail.org/developers/) list 200+ organisations that create Wagtail sites, some of which likely will be hiring. The profiles are ordered by number of Wagtail sites published, which helps getting a sense of the size of an organisation’s Wagtail practice.
