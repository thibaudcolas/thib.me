[**Register as a Steering Council candidate**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiBMlGspTw7hZ3rGvWisLSIrnGYKJECMYr1fSCNULAI5A7gw/viewform)

## Eligibility

Candidate eligibility requirements are defined in [DEP 12: The Steering Council](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0012-steering-council.rst#specification). To be qualified for elections, we require both of the following:

- A history of substantive contributions to Django or the Django ecosystem. This history must begin at least 18 months prior to the individual's candidacy for the Steering Council, and include substantive contributions in at least two of these bullet points:

  - Code contributions on Django projects or major third-party packages in the Django ecosystem
  - Reviewing pull requests and/or triaging Django project tickets
  - Documentation, tutorials or blog posts
  - Discussions about Django on the django-developers mailing list or the Django Forum
  - Running Django-related events or user groups

- A history of engagement with the direction and future of Django. This does not need to be recent, but candidates who have not engaged in the past three years must still demonstrate an understanding of Django's changes and direction within those three years.
