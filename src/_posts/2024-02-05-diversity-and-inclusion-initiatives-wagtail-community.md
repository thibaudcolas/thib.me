A high-level overview of past and current initiatives in the Wagtail community around diversity and inclusion, and potential improvements.

<!-- more -->

Are there high-level things we should do differently? Things we’re doing already we should highlight better? Things that other people are doing and we could learn from?

I started thinking about this thanks to [Django adopting the DEI.md file](https://github.com/django/.github/pull/2), as part of the [CHAOSS DEI Badging Initiative (previously All-In)](https://badging.chaoss.community/project-badging/dei-file). We attempt to report on our progress with [accessibility](https://wagtail.org/accessibility/) and [sustainability](https://wagtail.org/sustainability/) initiatives via standardised methodologies where possible, so adopting a format to share how we’re doing at diversity and inclusion feels appropriate. On how we’re doing – there’s room for improvement as always, but I think we have quite good momentum with accessibility and sustainability initiatives, outreach programs like GSoC and Outreachy, and generally welcoming all contributors and all contributions.

Nonetheless, thought of three potential things we could do that feel like they’d be "quick" wins:

1. Having a [DEI.md file](https://badging.chaoss.community/project-badging/dei-file) for Wagtail, or equivalent page on our website, so we share our work in this space in a clear format.
2. If DEI.md isn’t the right format, defining our work in another form. Perhaps a policy document, perhaps a "showcase" page on wagtail.org.
3. Setting up a dedicated team for people interested in working in this space (I wrote a [draft charter](https://gist.github.com/thibaudcolas/993900190491ad21153c3f6bdf3ae49e) as an experiment but didn’t take it anywhere.
4. Reviewing our progress against other established resources like [Mozilla’s Diversity & Inclusion in Open Source docs](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion)

Does that feel right or perhaps too much work for a project of our size?

## Past efforts

Here are the types of things we’ve tended to be involved with:

- [Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc)
- [Outreachy](https://github.com/wagtail/outreachy)
- [Django Girls+](https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/add_wagtail_to_your_website/)
- [Coders of Colour](https://intro-wagtail.netlify.app/)
- [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
- [Wagtail Space](https://www.wagtail.space/)

## Possible improvements

And specific possible improvements I’ve seen being discussed recently:

- Sustain current outreach efforts
- Wagtail Space travel grants
- Code of conduct process
- Funding for diversity initiatives
- Recognize more kinds of contributions
- Diversity metrics
- Public statement on diversity
