Our DjangoCon 2023 workshop on headless Wagtail with Next.js.

<!-- more -->

üëã welcome to a self-paced headless CMS workshop! This workshop covers:

- Initial project setup: what Wagtail and Next.js are, and how to set them up
- Connecting Next.js with the backend
- Deployment!

The workshop was created for DjangoCon Europe 2023 by [@laymonage](https://github.com/laymonage) and [@thibaudcolas](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) ‚Äì but we expect it can all be done on your own anytime.
