Each year, our friends at JetBrains, the creators of PyCharm, run an incredible deal. You get a 30% discounted year of PyCharm, AND the DSF gets 100% of the money. Yes, 100%! It's making a donation and directly getting a great product in return! This is available for new users, and those who had used PyCharm in the past, stopped, and want to try again.

## The fundraiser

The fundraiser started [during DjangoCon Europe in June](https://www.djangoproject.com/2024/jun/06/pycharm-django-campaign-2024/), and is now back on from September 22nd to October 6th. Buy PyCharm and support Django!In the past, JetBrains through the PyCharm fundraiser has provided approximately one quarter of the Django Software Foundation's budget! Donations like this fundraiser allow the DSF to function. Our two wonderful Fellows, Natalia Bidart and Sarah Boyce keep Django running smoothly, picking up pieces that would otherwise not happen.The other side of the DSF is our support for Django groups across the globe. We supported every DjangoCon, particularly with donating funding towards opportunity grants for more people to be able to attend these conferences. The DSF also supports smaller events around the world, including DjangoGirls events.
