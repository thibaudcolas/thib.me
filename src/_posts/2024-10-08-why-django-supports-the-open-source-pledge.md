We at the Django Software Foundation are pleased to share that Sentry, alongside other partners, has launched the Open Source Pledge — an initiative designed to address sustainability challenges in open source.

<!-- more -->

The [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) is a commitment for member companies to pay OSS maintainers meaningfully for their work. When maintainers are adequately supported, they can better sustain their projects, ensuring the growth, stability, and security of the broader ecosystem.

## The sustainability challenge in the Django community

In our community and OSS at large, the challenge is real and significant. Django packages are often maintained by small teams or even individuals, often unpaid. As the demands on these projects grow, so too does the pressure on the maintainers. And without financial support, maintainers often move on without a clear succession plan. The potential failure of these projects not only impacts the developers involved but also the thousands of companies and millions of users who rely on these critical pieces of infrastructure.

Here are a few assorted examples from Django packages in the top 10 by download counts:

- [Is DRF still considered alive?](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/discussions/8110), [Moving REST framework forward](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/discussions/9270)
- [Lots of open PRs with no feedback or action](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages/issues/1266)
- [Recruiting maintainers](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers/issues/110)
- [We need more roadies in jazzband](https://github.com/jazzband/help/issues/196)

## The case for joining the pledge

We need companies to pay maintainers, or the 15,000 packages in Django's ecosystem will be at risk. By joining the Open Source Pledge, you are investing in the stability, security, and growth of the entire tech ecosystem.

The Open Source Pledge is simple but impactful: member companies commit a minimum of $2,000 per year, per developer on staff, to support open source maintainers. Additionally, companies are encouraged to publish an annual report detailing their payments, creating transparency and accountability within the community.

If you're interested in joining the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) or learning more about the sustainability issues facing OSS, please visit the initiative’s page. Together, we can build a stronger, more sustainable open source future. And if you believe in this cause, we encourage you to share this post to help broaden awareness and inspire further commitments from peers and partners.
