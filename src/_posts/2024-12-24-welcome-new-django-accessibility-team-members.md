## What’s next

In truth, our four new accessibility team members joined the team months ago – shortly after we published our [2023 accessibility team report](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/feb/10/django-accessibility-in-2023-and-beyond/). Up next, a lot of the team will be present at FOSDEM 2025, organizing, volunteering, or speaking at the [Inclusive Web Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/inclusive-web/).
