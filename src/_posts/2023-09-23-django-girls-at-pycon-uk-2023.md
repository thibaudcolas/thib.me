Iâ€™m happy I took part in another Django Girls workshop as a coach, and also found ways to contribute back to the tutorial along the way.

<!-- more -->

Whenever I coach Django Girls, I always go through the tutorial again, before the event whenever possible.
This time, I decided to go through it during the event as well, with fresh GitHub and PythonAnywhere accounts, to be as close to the "first time" experience as I could.

## Issue triage

I reviewed a number of issues and commented on a few:

- [Missing step in the CSS section #1596](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial/issues/1596)

- [Change os.path.join to Pathlib / #1770](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial/pull/1770)
