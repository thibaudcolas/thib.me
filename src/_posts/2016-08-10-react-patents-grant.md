I have been using React at work and personally for more than a year now. It’s been a great experience overall, and this library seems to be having a profound impact on front-end development (in good and bad ways). There is a lot of FUD around React’s PATENTS file. I'm no lawyer, so this blog post is just a list to the resources I have gathered over time on the topic.

<!-- more -->

And by resources, I mostly mean Dan Abramov’s numerous tweets. I could write entire blog posts and make entire talks consisting solely of his tweets.

Note that most of those resources do not have legal value, they are just here to show that people in companies of all sizes do feel comfortable using React, and that the language in this file does not impact their day to day life.
