The data is there if you look just below the surface.

<!-- more -->

Today I learned [docs.python.org Plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/docs.python.org) are publicly available, which is pretty cool! Right away my eye was drawn to the stats on visitors from around the world:

![Map of the world countries with docs.python.org visitor statistics. The USA is very brightly colored, with Russia, China, and India in medium tones. The rest of the world is in very dark tones](/images/blog/python-is-big-in-europe/plausible-io-docs-python-org.webp)

Notice how in this, the US of A is shown \_so much\_ brighter than anywhere else in the world? The 30-day visitors count is at 999k.

Itâ€™s interesting how much that country-level binning is misleading, and accordingly, how big Python actually is in Europe (and other regions) if you look at more granular numbers. It only takes 8 of the top European countries to get above the 1M visitors mark:

1. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany, 245k
2. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom, 227k
3. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France, 177k
4. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain, 93k
5. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland, 80.2k
6. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy, 78.6k
7. ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands, 74.4k
8. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine, 66.5k

Thatâ€™s without counting Russia, some of which is very much in Europe, but Iâ€™m not sure how much. The top 7 countries are in the European Union, and we arrive at 974k visitor. The addition of Ukraine takes us over the 1M mark.

## What it means

For me personally, itâ€™s interesting because 10 years ago I was delighted to land a Python gig compared to the PHP and Java jobs that were the norm in my local sphere. Now it feels like Python (or at least Django) gigs are all over the place in Europe. Just look at the latest 10 offers on [Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com/), majority are there.

For projects like Python / Wagtail / Django, I hope it also means a renewed focus on multilingual capabilities, and localization. Itâ€™s almost comical how bad [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) is, thereâ€™s a big need for a better baseline ([MessageFormat 2](https://messageformat.dev/), [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/), Iâ€™m not sure).

In the short term â€“ I guess that means weâ€™ll see you all Europeans atÂ [DjangoCon Europe 2025](https://2025.djangocon.eu/)Â in April andÂ [EuroPython 2025](https://ep2025.europython.eu/)Â in July? And for Wagtailersâ€¦Â [Wagtail Space](https://www.wagtail.space/)Â 2025 plans TBA soon ðŸ¤«
