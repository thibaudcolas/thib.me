For this yearâ€™s FOSDEM conference, our Django accessibility team organized the "Inclusive Web" track. Hereâ€™s a recap of how it went!

<!-- more -->

The idea for the [Inclusive Web devroom](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/inclusive-web/) started at FOSDEM 2024, where we discussed the importance of showcasing accessibility and inclusivity work in open source, in web development and beyond. The [Django accessibility team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#accessibility-team) got to work on a FOSDEM 2025 proposal. Lo and behold, it got accepted, and here we are with a room full of people interested in those topics, and a great lineup of speakers!

The room was full for most of the day with about 70 attendees, with the conference also providing a livestream for remote participants. We had a great mix of talks, covering a lot of the aspects of the Inclusive Web that we wanted to showcase.

## The talks

### [Top Accessibility Errors Found in Open Source Through Automated Testing](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6075-top-accessibility-errors-found-in-open-source-through-automated-testing/)

<div style="flex: 1; min-width: min(400px, 95vw);">

<p>In the first talk of the day, Raashi Saxena shares insights on the most common accessibility errors in open-source projects, based on manual and automated testing. She highlights real-world case studies to help developers improve accessibility in their projects â€“ and warn against the legal risks of poor accessibility!</p>

### [Solving the worldâ€™s (localization) problems](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5561-solving-the-world-s-localization-problems/)

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap: clamp(1rem, 10vw, 4rem);">

<div style="flex: 1; min-width: min(400px, 95vw);">

<p>Eemeli Aro and Ujjwal Sharma introduce <a href="https://messageformat.dev/">MessageFormat 2</a>, a new standard to address long-standing localization challenges. They discuss its potential applications and the tools being built around it. This standard is very promising for Django developers working on multilingual applications to provide better translations for users, and better capabilities for translators.</p>

He demonstrates his <a href="https://github.com/CivicActions/site-evaluation-tools/blob/main/alt-text-scan.py.md">alt text scan Python script</a> for auditing alt-text across websites. Alt text is a common issue on Django projects, and the AI generation showcased by Mike has the potential to move the needle.</p>

## See you in 2026

We had a blast running this devroom, and weâ€™re looking forward to doing it again in 2026 if we get the chance! Thank you to our speakers, devroom organizers (Saptak, Tom, Sarah, Thibaud, Eli), and helpers (Alex and Storm) for making this event a success! ðŸŽ‰
