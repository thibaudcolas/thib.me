For the second time, I’m joining Google’s open source internships program with Wagtail as a mentor and organization administrator.

It's official! Following our [participation to Outreachy](https://wagtail.org/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/) in the December 2022 cohort, Wagtail is taking part in [Google Summer of Code](https://wagtail.org/blog/going-green-with-google-summer-of-code/).

This year, our two projects have a [sustainability](https://wagtail.org/sustainability/) focus, and are run in partnership with the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) and [Green Coding Berlin](https://www.green-coding.berlin/).
