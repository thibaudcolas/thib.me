We had a great time; and hope you did too. See you next at Wagtail Space in the US and Netherlands?

*¡Qué rápido pasa el tiempo!* We had a blast at [DjangoCon Europe 2024](https://2024.djangocon.eu/) in Vigo. High-quality talks, and the Spanish seaside as a backdrop – a recipe for success. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of the conference from the perspective of our Wagtail attendees.

## The talks

They were all pretty excellent! A personal highlight was [Empowering Django with Background Workers](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2024/talk/VDYCVB/) by our core team member Jake Howard. As well as the technical excellency, this talk is a solid example of the Django Enhancement Proposal (DEP) process, and of Wagtail work making its way back to Django (the DEP started as [a Wagtail RFC](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/72)).

In the lightning talk corner, we really liked the CV (or is it *résumé?*) tips by [Josh O'Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-obrien-4639ab68/). Instantly actionable insights!

## The workshops

Our accessibility team member [Saptak S](https://github.com/SaptakS) gave an excellent set of [demos of accessibility considerations](https://github.com/SaptakS/django-accessibility-demos) for Django developers, all live before-after comparisons. One of those examples is alt text, where Saptak is also supporting a [Google Summer of Code internship](https://wagtail.org/blog/two-contributors-join-wagtail-for-google-summer-of-code-2024/) to provide better defaults in Wagtail.

We also had two of the Wagtail core team members giving workshops!

- [Supercharge your Developer Experience with VS Code, Dev Containers and Codespaces](https://github.com/dawnwages/supercharge-your-DX) by Dawn Wages
- [Blogging with Django: get started with Wagtail](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/django-blogging-wagtail) by Thibaud Colas

## The sprints

Over the weekend, we contributed to Django sprints with all sorts of tasks:

- Thibaud worked on his proposal for a [package maintainers team](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/pull/19) for the Django ecosystem, directly inspired by a similar [packaging team proposal](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Packaging-Team) for Wagtail
- Jake worked on [django-tasks](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks), a reference implementation of the Background Workers DEP.

Dawn worked on her yet-to-be-revealed Wagtail Space US talk 🤫, and gave a tour of Wagtail to Django Girls Harare organizer Kudzayi Bamhare.

## The atmosphere

A boat trip, a venue rooftop party – it was lovely. My personal highlights here are two efforts to bring some of the conference experience to people who couldn’t be there in person:

- Paolo Melchiorre’s excellent coverage of the conference with live posts at [#DjangoConEurope2024](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DjangoConEurope2024).
- Organizers providing a livestream hybrid experience with venueless. They even provided free access to everyone who applied for an opportunity grant but didn’t get approved!

## Up next: to Wagtail Space and beyond!

We have a packed schedule this month with [two more events coming up](https://wagtail.org/blog/to-wagtail-space-and-beyond-a-month-of-live-wagtail-events/) 🌈 Dawn will be presenting at [Wagtail Space US](https://us.wagtail.space/), and Jake at [Wagtail Space NL](https://nl.wagtail.space/). Join us at those events for more of the same quality of talks, workshops, and sprints.
