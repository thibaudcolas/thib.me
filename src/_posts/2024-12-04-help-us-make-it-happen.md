## Other ways to give

- [Official merchandise store](https://django.threadless.com/) - Buy official t-shirts, accessories, and more to support Django.

## Why give to the Django Software Foundation?

Our main focus is direct support of Django's developers. This means:

- Organizing and funding development sprints so that Django's developers can meet in person.
- Helping key developers attend these sprints and other community events by covering travel expenses to official Django events.
- Providing financial assistance to community development and outreach projects such as [Django Girls](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/dec/04/help-us-make-it-happen/#django-girls).
- Providing financial assistance to individuals so they can attend major conferences and events.
- Funding the [Django Fellowship program](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/dec/04/help-us-make-it-happen/#fellowship-program), which provides full-time staff to perform community management tasks in the Django community.
