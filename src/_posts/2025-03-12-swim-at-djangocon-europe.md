Join us for a dip in the Irish Sea in Dublin?

<!-- more -->

We have a bit of a [DjangoCon Europe](https://2025.djangocon.eu/) tradition going on with Tom Carrick to always go for a swim during the conference, no matter the location, time of year,â€¦ weather ðŸ˜¬ I swear itâ€™s fun and you should try it out!

This year, thereâ€™s great spots on the Irish Sea just 10 min away from the conference venue. This oneâ€™s called Forty Foot ([pic by Vladimir Zakharov](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dublinart/8367606618)).
