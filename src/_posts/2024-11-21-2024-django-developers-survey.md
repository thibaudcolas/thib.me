The DSF is once again partnering with JetBrains to run theÂ [2024 Django Developers Survey](https://jb.gg/asjljo)Â ðŸŒˆ

<!-- more -->

Please take a moment to fill it out! It should only take about 10 minutes to complete. Itâ€™s an important metric of Django usage, and is immensely helpful to guide future technical and community decisions.

[**Take the survey**](https://jb.gg/asjljo)

The survey will be open until December 21st, 2024. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results. JetBrains will also randomly choose 10 winners (from those who complete the survey in its entirety with meaningful answers), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent.

### How you can help

Once youâ€™ve done the survey, take a moment to re-share on socials? And with your communities. The more diverse the answers, the better the results for all of us. Here are the relevant posts to boost:
