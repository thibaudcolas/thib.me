I took part in the [HTTP Archive 2022 Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility) as a data analyst and writer for the Accessibility chapter.

This was extensive work lasting months, getting familiar with the dataset and past queries, to help the team figure out what to include in the chapter. My [chapterer](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/chapterer) project helped automate quite a bit of the data updating compared to the 2021 chapter.
