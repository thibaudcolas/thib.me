Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹ It is that time of year again when we recognize someone from our community in memory of our friend Malcolm.

<!-- more -->

Malcolm was an early core contributor to Django and had both a huge influence and impact on Django as we know it today. Besides being knowledgeable he was also especially friendly to new users and contributors. He exemplified what it means to be an amazing Open Source contributor. We still miss him to this day.

## The prize

TheÂ [Django Software Foundation Prizes](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/prizes/)Â page summarizes it nicely:

> The Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize is a monetary prize, awarded annually, to the person who best exemplifies the spirit of Malcolmâ€™s work - someone who welcomes, supports, and nurtures newcomers; freely gives feedback and assistance to others, and helps to grow the community. The hope is that the recipient of the award will use the award stipend as a contribution to travel to a community event -- a DjangoCon, a PyCon, a sprint -- and continue in Malcolmâ€™s footsteps.

Please make your nominations using our form:Â [2024 Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize](https://forms.gle/omLMemzRaDREreCAA). Nominations are welcome from everyone.

We will take nominations untilÂ **Monday, September 30th, 2024,Â [Anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe)**, and will announce the winner(s) soon after the next DSF Board meeting in October.
