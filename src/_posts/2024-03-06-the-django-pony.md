Did you know about the "Pony question"?

<!-- more -->

It’s a thing: [Django Merchandise & Pony question](https://groups.google.com/g/dsf-members/c/aCKg_i_HfA4/m/f8YpiEDjBgAJ). The Django pony has its own website, [djangopony.com](https://djangopony.com/), and yet it’s pretty hard to get stickers of it.

Well, fear no more! The source is well documented: [iStock Photo: Fairy Tale Vector Elements stock illustration](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/fairy-tale-vector-elements-gm91230581-3355498?st=3eb57c4). It’s also very clear how to get a license. So I got one, that allows printing (and possibly selling) stickers.

And here we are, stickers!
