EuroPython 2025 is in Prague. You should definitely come by train if you can! Hereâ€™s how.

## The goal

Why would we do this? Well to reduce our carbon footprint of course! The main carbon emissions related to conferences are from transportation, specifically flights from attendees who arenâ€™t local. We can reduce this by encouraging people to use lower-footprint modes of transport, like trains.

## Who this is for

A lot of people! For a conference in Prague, right in the middle of Europe everyone whoâ€™s in the green areas on this [isochrone map centered on Prague](https://www.chronotrains.com/en/station/3067696-Prague?maxTime=8) can reach the city within a day by train:

Vienna, Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Bratislava are in there. Large swaths of Poland and Germany. Outside this map, avoiding flights is definitely still possible â€“ with overnight trains! Check out the [European Sleeper](https://www.europeansleeper.eu/), which has services to Prague from Brussels and Amsterdam, or [NightJet](https://www.nightjet.com/). This makes Prague reachable by train from Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, France, Switzerland, Italy, and more!

Itâ€™s a much longer journey than flying, and occasionally more expensive too. But also much lower-carbon, more relaxing. And more adventurous!

## How the carbon footprint compares

Hereâ€™s the results of my calculations, comparing the footprint of flights vs. train routes starting in European cities that allow travel to Dublin within this "one-day trip":

| Starting from | Flight (kgCO2e) | Train + ferry (kgCO2e) |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prague        | 64              | 16 (-75%)              |
| Paris         | 104             | 18 (-82%)              |
| Amsterdam     | 79              | 20 (-75%)              |
| Brussels      | 80              | 19 (-76%)              |
| Cologne       | 151             | 23 (-85%)              |

On average thatâ€™s about 80% lower carbon footprints! Numbers will vary a bit for actual journeys but the math here is pretty solid.

Note: Ferry figures come from. [Stena Line ferry carbon footprint calculator](https://stenaline.com/sustainability/carbon-footprint-calculator/). Train travel from the UK government [train travel emissions figures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-reporting-guidelines-including-mandatory-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reporting-guidance), and [Eurostar sustainability figures](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/sustainability). Flight figures come from Google Flights, cross-referenced with [Green Events Tool](https://greeneventstool.com/).

If you want the details, hereâ€™s the spreadsheet: [Travel emissions to Dublin - DjangoCon Europe 2025](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dz2oXE9F5shdXhUHLtXB71ongxhHrLuymRjmwc4zptM/edit?usp=sharing).

## The journey

If youâ€™re interested, [The Man in Seat 61](https://www.seat61.com/train-and-ferry-to-dublin.htm) is the best resource to prepare trips like this. But hereâ€™s the rough route plan:

![Train travel routes shown on a satellite imagery map, with points for Cologne, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Dublin](/images/blog/train-to-djangocon-europe-2025-in-dublin/eurostar-to-dublin.jpg).

The TL;DR; is you should get yourself a [SailRail tickets by Transport for Wales](https://tfw.wales/ways-to-travel/rail/ticket-types/sailrail), which is about 120 euros for a return trip, and includes train travel in the UK and the ferry crossing. Then get a Eurostar ticket to reach Prague. Trains depart from Prague in the early morning and early afternoon. Roughly-speaking, if you can make it to Brussels or Paris by 1pm, youâ€™ll be in Dublin by the end of the day.

## If we all did this

If you spend some time projecting those emissions reductions as if everyone attending from those places took the train and ferry, you arrive at:

- Emissions from UK attendees going from 7 to 1.6 tons of CO2
- Netherlands travel emissions going from 8.5 to 1.5 tons
- Germany (Frankfurt) from 8.5 to 1.2 tons
- France (Paris) from 3 tons to 0.5 tons
- Belgium (Brussels) from 1.5 to 0.25 tons

All in all, if everyone within this isochrone "day trip" map made the trip via the ferry and train, it would take the conferenceâ€™s total travel footprint from well above 100 tons of CO2, to well under it.

## Do it!

I got my tickets today! If you can make it with the ferry and train, great. If not, whether due to travel times or cost, definitely come anyway! See you at [DjangoCon Europe 2025](https://2025.djangocon.eu/).
