Planning future API improvements.

<!-- more -->

Are you interested in building [headless](https://wagtail.org/headless/) / API-first websites? We need your feedback to inform Wagtail’s direction for headless support improvements, as part of our [2024 Wagtail headless survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbKQC_hixs5Hktt2P6TOM1nr_aznhrPioaWBe5X_qTl76t5Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). All fields are completely optional and this should only take a few minutes to fill in.

[Take the 2024 Wagtail headless survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbKQC_hixs5Hktt2P6TOM1nr_aznhrPioaWBe5X_qTl76t5Q/viewform)

We know a lot of developers use Wagtail via its API only, so we’d love to make direct improvements for those use cases in Wagtail itself.

## Other surveys

If you haven’t already, consider taking the [2024 Django Developers survey](https://jb.gg/asjljo) as well! Its results help us understand the expectations of Django developers and make more informed decisions.

For Wagtail itself, check out our past survey results:
