Long time no see! Draftail [v1.4.0](https://github.com/springload/draftail/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v140) is out, another release focused on gradual editor improvements.

<!-- more -->

## Slightly better toolbar support

Itâ€™s now more formally supported to hide buttons.

## Better docs

Working hard on making sure the editor props are well documented, with better JSDoc annotations.
