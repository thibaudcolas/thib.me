Wuh! We did it! [Django Girls Wellington](https://djangogirls.org/wellington/) is a thing! I'm so glad we were able to pull this off.

This was a lot of effort from a lot of people, and I am very proud that we made it work. You could really feel the excitment on the day of the event, and people looked like they were genuinely having fun – coding for the first time!

Here are some of the pictures of the event for posterity.
