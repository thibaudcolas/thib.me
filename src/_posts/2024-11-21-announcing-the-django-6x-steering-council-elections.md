Today, we‚Äôre announcing early elections for the¬†[Django Software Foundation Steering Council](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#steering-council-team)¬†over the 6.x Django release cycle.

<!-- more -->

Elected members will be on the Steering Council for two years, from the end of those elections in December, until April 2027 with the scheduled start of the Django 7.x release cycle.

## Why we have early elections

The DSF Board of Directors previously shared¬†[Django‚Äôs technical governance challenges, and opportunities](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/nov/14/technical-governance-challenges-and-opportunities/). Now that the¬†[Board elections are completed](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/nov/17/2025-dsf-board-election-results/), we‚Äôre ready to proceed with this other, separate election, following existing processes. We will want a Steering Council who strives¬† to meet the group‚Äôs intended goals:

1. To safeguard big decisions that affect Django projects at a fundamental level.

2. To help shepherd the project‚Äôs future direction.

We expect the new Steering Council will take on those known challenges, resolve those questions of technical leadership, and update Django‚Äôs technical governance. They will have the full support of the Board of Directors to address this threat to Django‚Äôs future. And the Board will also be more decisive in intervening, should similar issues keep arising.
