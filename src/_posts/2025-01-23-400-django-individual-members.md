As of a few weeks ago, the Django Software Foundation reached 400 individual members.

<!-- more -->

I’m really happy with this! And particularly that the pace at which we gain new members is increasing. Those [400 members](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) all contributed to Django’s future. For a community-driven project like ours, individual contributors are essential.

## Nominate more people

We really do need more people. 400 members is a lot, but at the scale of Django that’s probably around 0.01% of the framework’s users. Nominate more people, and ask your friends and colleagues to do the same! Of the 152 people who joined the Foundation since October 2023, I nominated 50. It only takes a few minutes.

1. Read our [membership FAQ](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/faq/) to know what qualifies for membership.
2. Fill out the linked form.

If in doubt – please reach out! The TL;DR; of eligibility is we’re looking for people who make substantial or sustained contributions towards the [goals of the Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/):

> - Support development of Django by sponsoring sprints, meetups, gatherings and community events.
> - Promote the use of Django among the World Wide Web development community.
> - Protect the intellectual property and the framework's long-term viability.
> - Advance the state of the art in Web development.

Note how that last goal doesn’t even require contributing to Django itself.
