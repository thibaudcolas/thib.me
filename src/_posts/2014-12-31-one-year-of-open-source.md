The end of the year seems to be a good time to turn back and have a look at what those last 365 days were made of. I'll keep my 9-to-5 job out of the picture (I quit!) and just focus on what happened around OSS/GitHub and my personal projects.

<!-- more -->

In 2014:

* My blog got [13 new blog posts](/archives).
* I did [4 talks](https://thib.me/talks/) at various events.
* I created [34 PRs](http://thib.me/pr) for many projects on GitHub.
* My [main website](https://thib.me) was rebuilt from scratch.
* I did a **lot** of side-projects:
  * [Zori](https://github.com/FlipFlopWeekly/zori)
  * [JS1K](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/js1k-2014)
  * Something cool in Python: [When will it be done?](http://whenwillitbedone.trgdy.com/)
  * [JS13K](https://github.com/FatBoyCrew/elements-shmup)
  * A theme for jsonresume.org: [Eloquent](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/jsonresume-theme-eloquent)

Here's what my GitHub scorecard looks like:

Oh and, yeah, I quit my job in France and moved to New Zealand. Hopefully 2015 will be a beautiful year over here in Auckland.
