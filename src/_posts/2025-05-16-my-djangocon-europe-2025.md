It was lovely :)

<!-- more -->

I already wrote a post [for the DSF, DjangoCon Europe and beyond](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/may/14/djangocon-europe-and-beyond/), and [for Wagtail, DjangoCon Europe 2025 vibes and photos üì∑Ô∏è](https://wagtail.org/blog/djangocon-europe-2025-vibes-and-photos/). But here are my personal notes!

## The talks

To be completely honest, I was wearing many hats at the conference (DSF, DjangoCon Europe Code of Conduct, Wagtail), so I only managed to catch one talk from start to finish: [Europe, Django and two-factor authentication](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2025/talk/GABN73/) by Agn√®s Haasser. I also attended Jes√∫s Escribano‚Äôs workshop, [Building an unique voting system in Django: is possible?](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2025/talk/PBXJHB/). Both were great and I learned a lot :) I also caught almost all of Mia Bajiƒá‚Äôs [The Most Bizarre Software Bugs in History](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2025/talk/W3BQVT/) (will think of axle counts for the rest of my life), and Vince Salvino‚Äôs [One Thousand and One Django Sites](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2025/talk/LPUSJR/). And the lightning talks.

### The tasks

I did watch other talks but was heavily multi-tasking. I spent most of my time at the conference talking to people, but also doing specific tasks:

- Preparing for a DSF Board Q&A with Tom Carrick and Sarah Abderemane.
- Preparing, running, debriefing the [Annual meeting of DSF members](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/apr/09/annual-meeting-of-dsf-members-at-djangocon-europe/).
- Social media for Django channels.
- Code of Conduct team for the conference. There were only two of us in person at the event, so we had to be paying close attention to comms. Transparency report coming soon!
- Distributing Django stickers.
- Social media for Wagtail channels.
- Preparing a mini Wagtail meetup!
- And a Django accessibility team meeting.
- Preparing for the sprints

## The pictures

Quick picture from the annual meeting of DSF members (I don‚Äôt remember who took it, sorry!) ‚Äì was a really good session:

## The birthday

We‚Äôve been preparing super secret birthday celebrations for Django‚Äôs 20th birthday. Kept things casual at DjangoCon Europe, but we did sing "Happy birthday" twice üëÄ.

The first time:

And that second time. Apparently people can tell waiters your name is Django and they just get it done:
