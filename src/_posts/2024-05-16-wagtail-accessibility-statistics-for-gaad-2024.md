As part of #GAAD, this week we’re sharing accessibility stats & tips from Wagtail sites.

<!-- more -->

Just like for [Global Accessibility Awareness Day in 2023](https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/), here are statistics about the accessibility of sites built with Wagtail.

## **Python websites accessibility scores**

We saw a downwards trend compared to last year’s score, but Wagtail websites are still leading on accessibility in the Python ecosystem:

![Python websites accessibility scores - GAAD 2024](/blog/images/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2024/python-websites-accessibility-scores-gaad-2024.png)

This shows the mean accessibility score of Wagtail sites over time, compared to other Python technologies. Wagtail sites are consistently doing better – but only just (84 in April 2024, 85 in April 2023 – still above the 81 average for Django sites).

With appropriate targets and ongoing testing, there is no reason all sites couldn’t score a perfect "100" (no issues detected) on those tests.

_Data for this chart is from the_ [_Core Web Vitals Technology Report_](https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/new-dashboard-the-core-web-vitals-technology-report/2178)_._

## **Wagtail sites with no accessibility issues**

Aim higher with all things accessibility. Wagtail sites are doing better year over year, but there’s still lots to do:

![Wagtail sites with no accessibility issues - GAAD 2024](/blog/images/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2024/wagtail-sites-with-no-accessibility-issues-gaad-2024.png)

In 2024, we found 4.77% of Wagtail sites had no issues detected, compared to 4.44% in 2023 and 3.83% in 2022. Those numbers are [above industry averages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) but nowhere near our ambitions.

All sites could score a perfect "0 errors" detected - and then further spend time on manual tests which can also uncover fundamental issues.

We hope our commitment to the [ATAG 2.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) will help all Wagtail sites get there, with tools like our accessibility checker paving the way.

## **Success rate of Wagtail built-in checks**

We see great progress on all four common issues detectable with our built-in checker:

![Success rates for Wagtail accessibility checks - GAAD 2024](/blog/images/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2024/success-rates-for-wagtail-accessibility-checks-gaad-2024.png)

- **button-name**: 70% of Wagtail sites pass this, compared to 65% in 2023. A button element on the page is lacking a label. This is entirely detectable with automated tests such as those featured in our [built-in accessibility checker](https://wagtail.org/blog/introducing-wagtails-new-accessibility-checker/), built on Axe.
- **link-name**: 42% passing (38% in 2023). Just like button-name, one of the page’s links is missing its title.
- **heading-order**: 51% passing (50% in 2023). Some heading levels are getting skipped on the page – always have a main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).
- **frame-title**: 55% of sites passing (50% in 2023). A frame (such as an embedded video) is missing its title. Again entirely detectable with automated tests – and very simple to fix once identified!

It’s very encouraging how our built-in checks have resulted in tangible improvements! We’re now [looking for a financial sponsorship](https://wagtail.org/blog/looking-for-sponsorship-accessibility-checks-for-site-administrators/) to take this even further, and introduce more automated and manual accessibility checks.

_Here is the data for this graph:_ [LH checks 2024-04-01](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQXCSbvAtmdf7IArBT4RL3cvgldCUx1UPGzABC_g8Dc/edit#gid=2108116695)_._

## **Wagtail AI vs. existing alt text quality**

The Wagtail accessibility team found AI to be very promising for alt text, with consistently better quality than Wagtail sites are achieving currently:

![Wagtail AI vs. existing alt text quality - GAAD 2024](/blog/images/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2024/wagtail-ai-vs-existing-alt-text-quality-gaad-2024.png)

The team compared the alt text of real-world Wagtail images, with results generated by GPT-4 Vision. For 89% of images, the AI alt text was better than average; compared to 43% for the existing alt text.

This is tremendously promising and we hope to deliver those [Wagtail AI](https://wagtail.org/wagtail-ai/) improvements for all Wagtail websites in the near future, starting with a [Google Summer of Code 2024 internship](https://wagtail.org/blog/two-contributors-join-wagtail-for-google-summer-of-code-2024/).

## **Data and methodology**

The data we use comes from a dataset of the world’s top 15M website homepages: [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/). 4,000+ websites in this dataset are identified as using Wagtail.

From this dataset, we then extract specific statistics following the methodology of the [HTTP Archive Web Almanac’s accessibility chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility) – but filtering to only assess Wagtail projects.
