<div class="entry-content" data-no-instant><p>I just got a new job! I am now a Senior Front-End Developer at <a href="http://springload.co.nz/">Springload</a>, Wellington, New Zealand. This is amazing!</p>

<p>After two years working in the IT &amp; BPS consulting field at CGI, I was fed up with client work and I wanted something new. New Zealand was the right place to look for a job. Springload is the right place to work at. Wellington is a nice place to live in! I got it all!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In hindsight, I’d have only left my previous job and moved to New Zealand sooner. Here are a few reasons why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Zealand is the place. New Zealand has amazing scenery, nice weather, a very good tech scene and very kind people.</li>
  <li>IT salaries are high! The average IT salary for a Java/.NET developer with 2 years of experience is around NZD 75’000$, which is 50’000€ at the current exchange rate. My own salary nearly doubled: I’d have never dreamt of having such a raise by just finding the right job in the right place!</li>
  <li>The cost of life is quite low. It is definitely lower than in France.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to expand on this but it feels like I’m just bragging. If you’re thinking about moving to NZ, definitely get in touch: <a href="https://twitter.com/thibaud_colas">@thibaud_colas</a>.</p>

<p>So why Springload then? Well, at first because they were sponsporing New Zealand’s biggest conference (<a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/">Webstock</a>) and because they had many OSS projects on <a href="http://github.com/springload/">GitHub</a>. Because their work looked good, and I could definitely relate to what they said about their culture on their website.</p>

<p>Then because my first interview with the founder and our Front-end director went very well. The secund too. I was still in Auckland at the time, so they even flew me down to Wellington!</p>

<p>And that’s what got me sold in the end: I got to meet with the people I’d end up working with every day, I got to see that they had a great office and that they all seemed very happy working here. I got to see that it was an amazing place to work at!</p>

<p>So we just took our bags again, moved a few hundred kilometers again, and here I am at Springload. Yay!</p>
