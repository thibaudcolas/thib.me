    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce our participation in the 2023 Google Season of Docs program!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/google-season-of-docs-creating-wagtail-developer-onboarding-tutorials/seasonofdocs-visual.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This year, after a successful experience working with technical writers <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/our-very-first-outreachy-interns/">as part of Outreachy</a>, we’ve decided to take part in <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs">Google Season of Docs</a>. We’re aiming to create more comprehensive onboarding tutorials for developers, and get better at how we engage with technical writers in our community.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-google-season-of-docs">What is Google Season of Docs</h2>

<p>Google Season of Docs (or GSoD) is an annual program organized by Google to support open source projects improving their documentation, and to give professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. The program pairs writers with organizations to collaborate on specific documentation projects. It fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and appreciation for the essential role of documentation in software development.</p>

<p>This year, Google selected <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants">13 organisations</a> to support.</p>

<h2 id="why-were-taking-part">Why we’re taking part</h2>

<p>There are several reasons we decided to participate in GSoD this year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve our “getting started” documentation: We recognize that comprehensive, well-written documentation is crucial for the adoption and growth of any software project. Improving the “first thirty minutes of Wagtail” has been <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtail-vision/">part of our vision</a> for Wagtail in 2023 – focusing on the next few steps in developers’ onboarding feels natural.</li>
  <li>Learn from experienced technical writers: Collaboration with skilled technical writers brings fresh perspectives and insights that help us enhance our documentation processes and overall project communication. We got to see this happening for <a href="https://guide.wagtail.org/">guide.wagtail.org</a> during Outreachy, and are hoping to do the same for developer docs.</li>
  <li>Build relationships with the community: We hope GSoD will be a good opportunity to see how our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtails-new-developer-relations-team/">new Developer Relations team</a> operates. Building developer tutorials will be a good opportunity to reach out to our community for feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="our-project">Our project</h2>

<p>Here is what we expect the project to consist of at this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audit the existing Wagtail Get Started tutorial and create a friction log to ensure it is accessible and usable for newcomers.</li>
  <li>Use the friction log to update our primary tutorial and ensure it provides a strong basis for additional learning in the onboarding tutorial series.</li>
  <li>Review the Wagtail Bakery, an existing demo project used for teaching and testing, to determine which Wagtail features should be covered in the tutorials.</li>
  <li>Use the audit results to create a series of written tutorials for our documentation that teach newcomers how to build their own deployable Wagtail website using the newest version of Wagtail.</li>
  <li>Work with our community organisers to adapt the tutorials for open source beginners, which will support programs and workshops like Outreachy, GSoC, and Coders of Colour.</li>
  <li>Incorporate feedback from tutorial testers and the wider community.</li>
  <li>Work with the Wagtail core team to update our documentation and determine a process for maintaining the written tutorials going forward.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with our Developer Relations team to identify the best opportunities to share the tutorial with our community at upcoming events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>We’re <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2023#getting-involved">accepting applications</a> from technical writers until April 15th (reach out in the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">Wagtail Slack workspace</a> in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C051ERV9F9Q">#gsod channel</a> if you would welcome more time). We then hope to select a writer to work with by May 1st, and plan the next 6 months of work with them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re setting up a new contributors team for people interested in developer relations.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We’re now kickstarting a new developer relations team for Wagtail, to oversee how we engage with our community of developers. Sounds interesting? Consider joining!</p>

<h2 id="developer-relations">Developer relations</h2>

<p>As a general term, Developer Relations (or DevRel) is an umbrella term covering the relationships between Wagtail and developers within the project’s community. This encompasses marketing, training, community management, and other community-focused activities.</p>

<p>In the case of Wagtail – this could mean helping with our <a href="https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/">docs.wagtail.org</a> documentation site, or helping organise events such as <a href="https://www.wagtail.space/">Wagtail Space</a>. Or simply contributing developer experience focused improvements to the CMS.</p>

<h2 id="team-project-ideas">Team project ideas</h2>

<p>We’ve discussed a few project ideas that feel relevant already, though the team will decide for themselves once up and running:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining ready-to-use Wagtail tutorials or workshops – our current “Getting started” tutorial works well but is very short.</li>
  <li>Supporting Wagtail Space events – working with local organisers to make those events simpler to set up and run.</li>
  <li>Helping produce feature videos – to share the latest improvements made to the CMS.</li>
  <li>“Pitch Wagtail to your boss” slide deck – to describe Wagtail to stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Developer experience survey – helping us understand what capabilities would be most desirable to our main audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>

<p>If you want to help shape Wagtail’s future, consider joining for the initial 6-month membership! All backgrounds and levels of expertise welcome. In particular, we hope this team will work well for people who don’t code and still want to contribute to open source.</p>

<p>To join, come say hi in #developer-relations on the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/slack">Wagtail Slack</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the third time, Wagtail is joining Google’s open source internships program.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-cms-projects-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/wagtail-gsoc-social-preview.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s official! Following our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/">participation to Outreachy</a> in the December 2022 cohort, Wagtail is taking part in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-google-summer-of-code">What is Google Summer of Code</h2>

<p>Also known as GSoC, Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.</p>

<h2 id="project-ideas">Project ideas</h2>

<p>We’ve earmarked three project ideas this year.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme-for-wagtail-admin">Dark theme for Wagtail admin</h3>

<p><em>🚧 Update: we have discontinued this idea, as the work involved isn’t substantial enough to represent a GSoC project.</em></p>

<p>This is a continuation of past projects to make Wagtail’s color theme configurable, and accessibility improvements for Windows High Contrast mode users.</p>

<p>Here is the latest prototype of our dark theme, in a high contrast variant:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-cms-projects-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/dark-high-contrast.png" alt="Wagtail dark theme prototype, in high contrast mode" /></p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10056">Dark theme for the admin interface #10056</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rfc-72-background-workers">RFC 72: Background workers</h3>

<p>Wagtail currently doesn’t have a first-party solution for long-running tasks. Other CMSs in the ecosystem such as WordPress and Drupal have background workers, allowing them to push tasks into the background to be processed at a later date, without requiring the end user to wait for them to occur.</p>

<p>One of the key goals for this project is removing the requirement for the user to wait for tasks they don’t need to.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/72">RFC 72: Background workers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="greener-coding-wagtails-climate-impact">Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact</h3>

<p>We’re starting to have a better understanding of the<a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843">climate impact of Wagtail</a> as a CMS, and how we can reduce it. We want to integrate our findings into Wagtail’s direction, and make concrete improvements to the project to reduce related carbon emissions.</p>

<p>This project is part of a partnership with the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/">Green Web Foundation</a>, with mentors from both organisations.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-participate">How to participate</h2>

<p>Head over to our <a href="https://wagtail.org/gsoc">GSoC documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions">GSoC Discussions</a>. Review our contributor guide, and come say hi!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>We hope to hear from a lot of newcomers through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">application period</a>, where candidates get to know different communities and apply to projects. We’ll make sure to share more information about projects that are going ahead and their respective contributors once details are confirmed, closer to the summer.</p>

    <link href="https://thib.me/measuring-dark-mode-energy-savings"/>
    <updated>2022-11-23T21:18:03+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/measuring-dark-mode-energy-savings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve heard lots over the year that “dark themes for sites use up less energy”. Last week we bought a new OLED TV, which is the first OLED device I’ve ever owned, so I finally got a chance to experience whether / how much that was true.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>So I tested <a href="https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/">guide.wagtail.org</a>, on which we recently added a dark theme, displaying the homepage with the TV plugged into a watt meter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With the light theme, the TV uses 63W.</li>
  <li>With the dark theme, it uses 34W.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a stark difference but it gets worse: this TV has lots of onboard processing, so turning off the panel itself with everything else on, the TV still consumes 31W. Which means the TV panel consumes 3W to display in the dark theme, and 33W, 10x more, to display the light theme.</p>

<p>This reduction in power consumption only applies to OLED devices, which have a limited market share but are getting more common.</p>

<h2 id="testing-a-real-world-website">Testing a real-world website</h2>

<p>The Wagtail user guide is a real production site but doesn’t necessarly represent a typical site: it’s text-heavy, even on its homepage. Let’s now try out <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/">rnib.org.uk</a>, for which my company recently implemented a dark theme.</p>

<p>Here’s the results on my TV:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/measuring-dark-mode-energy-savings/rnib-oled-energy.jpg" alt="Side-by-side shots of the RNIB website with a power meter in front. On the left is a light theme where the power meter says 59.1. On the right dark theme and the power meter says 35.8" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>With the light theme, the TV uses 59.1W.</li>
  <li>With the dark theme, the TV uses 35.8W.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the  same 31W for TV components other than the panel, this means a panel consumption of 28W for the light theme, and 4.8W for the dark theme. That’s a 83% reduction in power consumption.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, Wagtail is joining Outreachy’s open source internships program</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/outreachy-banner.jpg" alt="Outreachy - Internships supporting diversity in Free and Open Source Software" /></p>

<p>As an experienced open source contributor, onboarding newcomers into the world of open source is amongst the most rewarding tasks. After a successful participation to <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/google-summer-of-code-2022-wagtail-midterm/">this year’s Google Summer of Code</a>, we’re back at it already with <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>, joining their December 2022 cohort.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-outreachy">What is Outreachy</h2>

<p>Outreachy provides <strong>internships in open source and open science.</strong> The program provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by under-representation in the technical industry where they are living. Internships are fully remote, over 3 months, with interns receiving a fair stipend to support their work.</p>

<p>For Wagtail, this type of program is one of the best ways to work with more diverse contributors. We’re elated to have been selected, and hope we’ll get to work with between one and three new contributors this year.</p>

<h2 id="the-project-ideas">The project ideas</h2>

<p>Compared to Google Summer of Code, Outreachy only allows mentors to propose project ideas, rather than candidates. We’ve earmarked three project ideas.</p>

<h3 id="a-built-in-accessibility-checker-for-wagtail">A built-in accessibility checker for Wagtail</h3>

<p>This project is fundamental to meeting our <a href="https://wagtail.org/accessibility/">accessibility commitments</a>. The primary goal is to integrate an existing accessibility test suite within the CMS in a way that takes advantage of the tool’s capabilities and Wagtail’s UI specificities. We envision this being part of Wagtail’s content previews: as the page content changes, authors see what the published page would look like, and get feedback on accessibility issues.</p>

<p>Here is a sneak peak at our first prototype:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/sa11y-prototype.png" alt="Screenshot of a prototype accessibility checker built into Wagtail's live preview" /></p>

<p><em>For more information about this project, to ask questions and provide feedback, follow</em> <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/9262"><em>discussion #9262 Built-in Accessibility Checker</em></a><em> on GitHub.</em></p>

<h3 id="improving-wagtails-editor-guide">Improving Wagtail’s editor guide</h3>

<p>This project follows through <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/google-summer-of-code-wagtail-editor-guide/">Hitansh Shah’s GSoC project</a>, where he created a new site for the Editor Guide documentation, with support from the project mentors. The new site looks fabulous:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/editor-guide.png" alt="Editor Guide landing page before-after" /></p>

<p>Now the next step is simply to revamp the content! This wasn’t part of Hitansh’s project, and is the perfect follow-up. We’re also very happy to propose a project idea where there is <strong>no need for contributors to know how to code</strong>.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this project, to ask questions and provide feedback, follow <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/guide/discussions/116">discussion #116 Outreachy: Improve user guide documentation for Wagtail</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="stimulus-for-interactive-widgets-in-wagtail">Stimulus for interactive widgets in Wagtail</h3>

<p>Following the leadership of our contributor LB, our UI team has been carefully considering how to bring Wagtail’s JavaScript interactivity to modern standards. This project is the natural follow-up to LB’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/78">RFC #78 for us to adopt Stimulus</a>: rolling it out across large swaths of the user interface.</p>

<p>The RFC is still going through the last stages of validation, so is the best way to follow up or comment on this project!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-participate">How to participate</h2>

<p>For aspiring newcomers already accepted in the December 2022 Outreachy cohort, head over to our <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Outreachy-2022">Outreachy 2022 wiki page</a> for more information about Wagtail, good resources, and a list of initial tasks.</p>

<p>For everyone else, we’d love to hear your thoughts on the project ideas, and are also actively looking for additional support so we can confidently take on all three projects. Join us in #outreachy on <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">Wagtail’s Slack workspace</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>We hope to hear from a lot of newcomers through the <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#current-timeline">initial contribution period</a>, where candidates get to know different communities and apply to projects. We’ll make sure to share more information about projects that are going ahead and their respective contributors once details are confirmed, towards the end of November.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We now have an <a href="https://wagtail.org/accessibility/">official accessibility statement</a>. This was the first time we publicly stated ATAG 2.0 as a conformance goal.</li>
  <li>We also published our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l7tnpEyJiC5BWE_JX0XCkknyrjxYA5T2aee5JgPnmi4/edit#gid=1433484179">(work in progress) accessibility audit</a>. It’s far from complete, but has already helped us prioritise specific improvements to the CMS.</li>
  <li>We made a big push to improve support for Windows high contrast mode as part of <a href="https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.15.html#windows-high-contrast-support">Wagtail 2.15</a>.</li>
  <li>We were also involved with the development of large features, earlier than might have been the case in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="windows-high-contrast-mode">Windows high-contrast mode</h3>

<p>This significant effort is worth highlighting for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The whole backlog of improvement came from a <a href="https://trello.com/b/MnlPSvkD/wagtail-high-contrast">large audit</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kbayliss">Kyle Bayliss</a>, which allowed us to understand the bigger picture of which practices in our development might be causing issues.</li>
  <li>In contrast, we were able to split the fixes <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3AAccessibility+is%3Aclosed+High-contrast+mode">over multiple tickets</a> to make those potential contributions more accessible to newcomers (in total, 12 people participated in those changes!).</li>
  <li>We got a sponsorship from <a href="https://assistivlabs.com/">Assistiv Labs</a> to simplify testing of Wagtail with different assistive technologies. Windows high contrast mode in particular was very hard for us to test until then.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is still a long way to go for us to achieve full support, but we feel better able to deliver this than ever. Here is what Windows high contrast mode looks like in Wagtail currently, tested via Assistiv Labs:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/state-of-wagtail-accessibility/whcm-wagtail.png"><img src="/images/blog/state-of-wagtail-accessibility/whcm-wagtail.png" alt="Screenshot of Windows high contrast mode in Assistiv Labs, with the main navigation opened over page listings" /></a></p>

<h3 id="what-we-didnt-achieve">What we didn’t achieve</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We were hoping to have accessibility team <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/19/office-hours/">office hours</a>, and never got round to starting this. If you would be interested, please <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">let us know on Slack in #accessibility</a>!</li>
  <li>One of the key features we wanted to scope was accessibility testing built into the CMS – we made plans internally, but didn’t draft a formal proposal as we had hoped. More on that soon!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>The elephant in the room for Wagtail’s accessibility improvements is the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/7739">Page editor 2022</a> project, which accessibility team members are heavily involved with. This marks a clear transition for us: from frequently fixing issues piecemeal after the fact; to being involved in every feature’s planning, making sure accessibility is considered.</p>

<p>We also get to direct the scope of the project – for example, recommending a wholesale replacement of the current datepicker, rather than a restyling.</p>

<p>A practical example of our involvement is the production of annotations for UI semantics and behavior, following the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6269661-Accessibility-Bluelines">Accessibility Bluelines</a> methodology:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/state-of-wagtail-accessibility/accessibility-bluelines.png"><img src="/images/blog/state-of-wagtail-accessibility/accessibility-bluelines.png" alt="Accessibility bluelines example for Wagtail, annotating the sidebar and top of the page editor" /></a></p>

<h3 id="accessibility-of-the-cms">Accessibility of the CMS</h3>

<p>We are and will be going through a lot of improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liaising with the Page editor 2022 project, and other features development, so accessibility requirements are included.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7751">Automated accessibility testing</a> of all pull requests, so ongoing QA isn’t as reliant on manual testing.</li>
  <li>Rolling out the most important accessibility-related changes from the page editor project, to the rest of the CMS.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also keep up with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">WCAG 2.2</a>’s publication, and drafts of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/">WCAG 3.0</a>.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-of-sites-built-with-wagtail">Accessibility of sites built with Wagtail</h3>

<p>The biggest change here will be the inclusion of built-in accessibility tests, as part of page previews when editing content. This is par for the course of ATAG 2.0 conformance, and we’re also gradually integrating findings from the <a href="https://accessibilitycluster.com/">We4Authors Cluster</a> research project, which details the most important accessibility features in content management systems.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regularly <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/7739">provide feedback on the Page editor 2022</a> project, based on your experience with Wagtail and other content management systems.</li>
  <li>Consider joining our accessibility team! We are looking for new members for the next 6 months or so, from all backgrounds, all skillsets.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, we’re particularly keen to hear from people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have personal experience of access and functional needs, or who are regular users of assistive technologies.</li>
  <li>Work on UX, design, or content – and can help us understand the needs of our users.</li>
</ul>

<p>To chat to the accessibility team directly, reach out to us <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">on Slack in #accessibility</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> is good. So good, it’s easy to get used to it, and subsequently want to retrofit it onto existing projects. Here’s a step-by-step guide and example: configuring and documenting Prettier and reformatting existing code, all the while making sure not to break other people’s work.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-example">The example</h2>

<p>All the steps described below are demonstrated publicly in a real-world project: Wagtail, via issue <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6059">#6059 Automatic code formatting with Prettier</a>. The implementation was split into two PRs: <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7908">#7908 Add Prettier configuration &amp; documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/7912">#7912 Prettier reformatting</a>, and finally one extra commit, <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/7eb8730d7372dc6b4752308a7e3354b36810f32e">7eb8730d7372dc6b4752308a7e3354b36810f32e</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, here are <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6059#issuecomment-1029941428">instructions on resolving conflicts</a> that weren’t directly stored in the repository (as this is a one-off task).</p>

<h2 id="why-two-prs-and-a-commit">Why two PRs and a commit</h2>

<p>I recommend always splitting the addition of any formatting tool into at least two PRs and the extra commit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first PR takes care of anything that requires careful review – configuration, integrations, documentation.</li>
  <li>The second PR takes care of the actual reformatting.</li>
  <li>Finally, the final commit is just there to finish setting up the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git-blame-ignore-revs</code> file for git’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignoreRevsFile</code></a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>This is actually the simplest step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update the project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.editorconfig</code> first, as Prettier reads it (<a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/cookbook/blob/main/.editorconfig">here’s an example</a>).</li>
  <li>Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prettier.config.js</code> with any desired options.</li>
  <li>Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.prettierignore</code>. I’d recommend to add large folders in here to speed up Prettier looking for files when using very broad glob patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I’ll always prefer to set all configuration options, even when using defaults. This saves having to remember what options are available that might not be set on the particular project when re-reviewing the configuration. I also always prefer using JavaScript for configuration – syntax highlighting and auto-formatting are dependable.</p>

<h3 id="which-languages-should-i-use-prettier-for">Which languages should I use Prettier for?</h3>

<p>I’d recommend all languages that Prettier supports, potentially with the exception of Markdown. Although the reformatting is excellent, enforcing a single format for documentation often feels cumbersome – particularly if the project’s documentation might often be updated by contributors with little knowledge of the project’s tooling.</p>

<p>If a supported language isn’t used, make sure to add its extension to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.prettierignore</code> so the files are consistently skipped. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Irrelevant files ignored for performance reasons.</span>
node_modules
public/
coverage/
vendor/
static
_build
<span class="c"># File types which Prettier supports but we don’t want auto-formatting.</span>
<span class="k">*</span>.md
<span class="c"># Files which contain incompatible syntax.</span>
<span class="k">*</span>.html
wagtail/admin/templates/wagtailadmin/edit_handlers/inline_panel.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

<p>I’ll always start with the same two commands:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="nl">"format"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"prettier --write '**/?(.)*.{css,scss,js,ts,tsx,json,yaml,yml}'"</span><span class="err">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"lint:format"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"prettier --check '**/?(.)*.{css,scss,js,ts,tsx,json,yaml,yml}'"</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The glob pattern might seem complicated – it’s wrapped in single quotes to prevent shell globbing (thus making it consistent cross-platform). It uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**/?(.)*</code> so files are checked at all directory levels in the current folder, and regardless of whether file names start with a dot or not.</p>

<p>As to where those commands should run – generally in continuous integration, potentially in Git pre-commit hooks.</p>

<h3 id="pre-commit">pre-commit</h3>

<p>With the confusingly-named <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit framework</a>, it looks like:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">repo</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier</span>
  <span class="na">rev</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">v2.5.1</span>
  <span class="na">hooks</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">prettier</span>
      <span class="na">types_or</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">css</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">scss</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">javascript</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">ts</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">tsx</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">json</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">yaml</span><span class="pi">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">types_or</code> aren’t always file extensions, they’re <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/identify/blob/master/identify/extensions.py">arbitrary identifiers</a> for some languages.</p>

<p>Here’s what I personally prefer – just bash:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span class="c"># Fail on first line that fails.</span>
<span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nt">-e</span>

<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="ides">IDEs</h3>

<p>VS Code has excellent Prettier support. Use it. I personally prefer to default to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">editor.formatOnSave</code> turned on, and only disable it per project that doesn’t have Prettier.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous integration</h3>

<p>We want to make sure we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint:format</code> on CI. Simple as that. Worth mentioning <a href="https://pre-commit.ci/">pre-commit.ci</a>, compatible with the same pre-commit framework as above, which runs formatting on your behalf and commits the changes to PRs. I personally don’t use it, but it works.</p>

<p>A common gotcha when setting up Prettier in CI is if your builds are optimised to only run when specific folders are changed – by definition, the Prettier checks will have to run whenever any file supported by Prettier changes.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Make sure your contributors are aware Prettier is in use, and that there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run format</code> command available for cases where Prettier formatting doesn’t get automatically applied in an editor.</p>

<h2 id="git-blame-compatibility">Git blame compatibility</h2>

<p>GitHub makes it easy to skip a commit in the blame view. For git itself, we can use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git-blame-ignore-revs</code> file. <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/main/.git-blame-ignore-revs">Prettier itself</a> has an excellent example, which is self-documenting:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># git-blame ignored revisions</span>
<span class="c"># To configure, run</span>
<span class="c">#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs</span>
<span class="c"># Requires Git &gt; 2.23</span>
<span class="c"># See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt</span>

<span class="c"># Prettier bump after release</span>
<span class="c"># 2.5.1</span>
4683a6284d53b913f129694a5be666fc55b06982
<span class="c"># 2.5.0</span>
846dbdd7e8c9deb315b3e663b3103c559e798a89
<span class="o">[</span>…]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-initial-reformatting">The initial reformatting</h2>

<p>All of the above steps should be done in the first PR, so they can easily be code reviewed. In the second PR, we can make the actual formatting changes. Run your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run format</code> now, and commit the results.</p>

<p>If your auto-formatting creates a lot of changes and you’ll want to review them manually – you could consider starting from a Prettier configuration that does fewer changes, commit the formatting, and add more changes gradually. This makes it easier to review different formatting changes overall.</p>

<h3 id="manual-issues-to-fix">Manual issues to fix</h3>

<p>If your project uses per-line linting disable comments, make sure the comments still target the correct lines after the reformatting. ESLint has an excellent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--report-unused-disable-directives</code> which helps a lot. Here’s an example where this happened:</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">-  // eslint-disable-next-line func-names
</span>  $(
    '#new a.task-type-choice, #new a.choose-different-task-type',
    modal.body,
<span class="gd">-  ).on('click', function () {
</span><span class="gi">+  ).on('click', function onClickNew() {
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There can be other compatibility issues with other static analysis tools, although that’s very rare. For example, I had to disable Prettier for a line where a Stylelint plugin wasn’t producing the expected output anymore – I’d suspect it’s the plugin’s analysis that’s causing the actual issue:</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">-  --#{$name}: hsl(
-    #{var(--#{$name}-hue),
-    var(--#{$name}-saturation),
-    var(--#{$name}-lightness)}
-  );
</span><span class="gi">+  // Prettier causes a linting issue when reformatting this.
+  /* prettier-ignore */
+  --#{$name}: hsl(#{ var(--#{$name}-hue), var(--#{$name}-saturation), var(--#{$name}-lightness) });
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve never encountered a case where Prettier changed the semantics of the code at runtime, except perhaps for <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#trailing-commas">trailing commas in function parameters</a>, which should be watched out for on projects that support legacy browsers.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-reformatting">After the reformatting</h2>

<p>Merge it all, making sure CI is linting for Prettier formatting, and passes. Then edit your project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git-blame-ignore-revs</code> with the correct reformatting commit, and that’s it.</p>

<p>For projects with other contributors – make sure to let them know there will be conflicts, and how to resolve them. Here are instructions I made for Wagtail:</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="instructions-to-rebase-in-progress-prs">Instructions to rebase in-progress PRs</h2>

<p>Here are the high-level steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rebase onto the commit before the reformatting (11ccf30f0044a326abef2a5c5568f373ffe46188, or can also be defined as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">af942a27e41b47e257b6cd46c01a13cd381fed04^1</code>, note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^1</code> suffix), with your usual rebasing methodology.</li>
  <li>Rebase onto the reformatting commit (af942a27e41b47e257b6cd46c01a13cd381fed04 / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">af942a27e41b47e257b6cd46c01a13cd381fed04</code>), always favouring your branch’s changes, and auto-applying Prettier reformatting.</li>
  <li>Rebase onto <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> with your usual rebasing methodology.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are step-by-step commands, tested on macOS with zsh:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Make a copy of your branch</span>
git branch save/my-existing-branch my-existing-branch
<span class="c"># Make sure you have the latest `main` from Wagtail</span>
git remote add upstream git@github.com:wagtail/wagtail.git
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
<span class="c"># Rebase onto the commit preceding the reformatting to resolve conflicts that would have been present anyway.</span>
git checkout my-existing-branch
git rebase af942a27e41b47e257b6cd46c01a13cd381fed04^1
<span class="c"># Install Prettier and other Wagtail development dependencies</span>
<span class="c"># Make sure you use Node v16 and npm v8</span>
node <span class="nt">--version</span>
npm <span class="nt">--version</span>
npm <span class="nb">install</span>
<span class="c"># Test-run Prettier – this should show formatting errors.</span>
npm run lint:format
<span class="c"># Rebase again, this time with the reformatting as the base,</span>
<span class="c"># always preserving your changes in case of conflicts, and automatically reformatting with Prettier.</span>
git rebase <span class="nt">--strategy-option</span><span class="o">=</span>theirs <span class="nt">--exec</span> <span class="s1">'(npm run format || true) &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit --amend --no-edit --no-verify'</span> af942a27e41b47e257b6cd46c01a13cd381fed04
<span class="c"># Test-run Prettier – this should show no formatting errors.</span>
npm run lint:format
<span class="c"># Finally rebase onto the latest version from Wagtail main, as per usual.</span>
git rebase main
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! There’s a small chance (see below) there may be conflicts with our linters, requiring further manual intervention. Run a final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> if you want to be sure.</p>

<p>There are a few things worth noting:</p>

<h3 id="its-a-bit-slow">It’s a bit slow</h3>

<p>This will reformat the whole project for every commit to be rebased, so it’s slow for PRs with lots of commits. It’d have been possible for us to only reformat the files changed by a given commit, but I was having trouble doing this in a cross-shell-compatible way.</p>

<h3 id="cases-where-manual-changes-will-be-needed">Cases where manual changes will be needed</h3>

<p>Once this is applied, there is still a risk there’ll be code that clashes with Prettier reformatting, which will need manual intervention. See for example <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/37026d521f818bab3724c74df93e9e690e93a9d5">37026d521f818bab3724c74df93e9e690e93a9d5</a>. I would expect this to be rare. As part of our main refactoring, there were two kinds of issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 conflict with Stylelint, where Prettier splitting a long expression into multiple lines changes how the expression is interpreted by our linting.</li>
  <li>8 conflicts with ESLint, where Prettier moved <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eslint-disable</code> comments in places where they no longer applied to the correct line.</li>
</ul>

<p>If in doubt, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> to check for any issues of this nature.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking for a Wagtail job? Or to hire a developer? Here are good places to check.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>There are more options than you might think! Wagtail being based on Django, anyone with a Django skillset will be productive with Wagtail. As such, this list is equally relevant when searching for or advertising Django developer jobs.</p>

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>

<p>This is my favourite option by far, with the #jobs channel in the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">Wagtail Slack</a>. Our Slack workspace is very active, with #jobs being one of the most viewed channels. Using chat also makes it much simpler for people to have a conversation about a given job offer.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the workspace’s statistics, showing 250 weekly active users:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/wagtail-developer-jobs-where-to-look/wagtailcms-stats-slack.png"><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-developer-jobs-where-to-look/wagtailcms-stats-slack.png" alt="Line chart of Weekly active members and messages posted, over December 2021 and January 2022. For Monday 10/01, there were 247 active members and 55 who posted messages" /></a></p>

<h2 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h2>

<p>This is a good option but the lead time is high, as there are only a few ad placements available per week.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://django-news.com/">Django News</a> – regularly includes Wagtail content.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pycoders.com/">PyCoder’s Weekly</a> – occasional mentions of Wagtail.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>

<p>There are a lot of great options here, with a good number of events recurring every year.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wagtail.space/">Wagtail Space</a>, and <a href="https://us.wagtail.space/">Wagtail Space US</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://2021.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://2022.pythonwebconf.com/">Python Web Conference</a> (coming up soon!)</li>
  <li><a href="https://djangoday.dk/">Django Day Copenhagen</a> (also coming up soon)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="job-listings">Job listings</h2>

<p>General-purpose job sites are always worth looking at for job offers matching “Wagtail” or “Django”. There are also a few specialised job boards:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/community/jobs/">Django jobs RSS</a>, aggregating other job boards.</li>
  <li><a href="https://djangojobs.net/">https://djangojobs.net/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://djangogigs.com/">https://djangogigs.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wagtail-developers">Wagtail developers</h2>

<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://madewithwagtail.org/developers/">Made with Wagtail developer profiles</a> list 200+ organisations that create Wagtail sites, some of which likely will be hiring. The profiles are ordered by number of Wagtail sites published, which helps getting a sense of the size of an organisation’s Wagtail practice.</p>

    <link href="https://thib.me/aria-invalid-true-with-aria-describedby"/>
    <updated>2022-01-12T22:42:03+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/aria-invalid-true-with-aria-describedby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of Django’s <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0011-accessibility-team.rst">accessibility team</a>, I’ve been doing a lot of research into specific patterns. Today – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-required="true"</code> combined with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> for error messages! Is it good? Is it redundant? What do authorative sources say?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>This is a copy of my <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/15036#issuecomment-1008738687">GitHub comment on django/django#15036</a> to keep for future reference</em>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h2>

<p>TL;DR; “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid ="true"</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> pointing at error message” seems to me like it would be the best for Django. It’s recommended in the non-normative <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA21">ARIA21</a> technique, and by a renowned expert in the field. I found one pattern that seems better than it in some cases, but I don’t think it’s as good of a fit for Django.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-for-the-pattern">Recommendations for the pattern</h2>

<p>I could find the following sources recommending <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code> usage alongside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The official (non-normative) <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA21">ARIA21 Using Aria-Invalid to Indicate An Error Field</a> technique from WCAG:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When visible text is used to programmatically identify a failed field and / or convey how the error can be corrected, setting aria-invalid to “true” is not required from a strict compliance standpoint but may still provide helpful information for users.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://web-a11y.slack.com/archives/C042TSFGN/p1557348802029700">post from Léonie Watson on the web-a11y Slack</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…]
Or you can use aria-describedby to make the association, like this:
[…] &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="text" id="this" aria-describedby="error" ...&gt;</code> &gt; […] &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p id="error"&gt;Don't forget to enter your first name!&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

  <p>You can also use aria-invalid=”true” on the input, as you have done, for belt and braces information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those two sources indicate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> pointing at the error message could be sufficient. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code> basically just helps unambiguously identifying fields that are in error, rather than relying on the wording of the error messages conveyed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> only.</p>

<h2 id="alternative">Alternative</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find anyone actively recommending against this combination, however the GOV.UK design system <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1168">decided not to use it</a>. They instead added an <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/#label">“Error:” prefix for all error messages</a>, as visually hidden / screen-reader-only text:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[…]
<span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"national-insurance-number-error"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"govuk-error-message"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"govuk-visually-hidden"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Error:<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span> Enter a National Insurance
  number in the correct format
<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;input</span>
  <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"govuk-input govuk-input--error"</span>
  <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"national-insurance-number"</span>
  <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"national-insurance-number"</span>
  <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span>
  <span class="na">aria-describedby=</span><span class="s">"national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error"</span>
<span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can see some clear advantages to this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s equally as unambiguous for screen reader users that the fields are in error (compare Django’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This field is required.</code> message or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter a whole number.</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error: This field is required.</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error: Enter a whole number.</code>).</li>
  <li>“Error:” is more plain language than “Invalid entry”</li>
  <li>Since this doesn’t rely on ARIA, screen reader support for this is better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I can also see some issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s more opinionated markup to maintain / less “by-the-book semantic HTML”</li>
  <li>Django’s error messages are meant to be customized with no oversight on how implementers will ultimately word them, so adding a prefix wouldn’t always be appropriate.</li>
  <li>It’s one more string that will need translations (not necessarily a big deal for such a generic word but does constraint the languages with which Django’s forms rendering could be used).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recommendation-for-django">Recommendation for Django</h2>

<p>Based on this, for Django, I’d still recommend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code> wherever possible, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code> for the error message wherever possible. So both together, wherever possible. It’s a more established pattern than bespoke error message prefixes, and lower maintenance. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code> support isn’t as good, but good enough for something that’s used <em>in addition to</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-describedby</code>.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is based on <a href="https://a11ysupport.io/">a11ysupport.io</a> data, which only tested support on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;select&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>I only looked at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid="true"</code>. There are other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-invalid</code> values, which are harder to use and I wouldn’t recommend at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the normative guidelines, all criteria also use <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/">stories of web users</a> to better convey what problems we are trying to prevent with those guidelines – and what “success” looks like.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good resources covering the new criteria in much better detail than we ever could – we’d highly recommend taking a look at Alastair Campbell’s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZlqSwgKuZE">WCAG 2.2: What’s new and what to do with it</a> at the Virtua11y conference.</p>

<h2 id="applying-wcag-22-to-sites">Applying WCAG 2.2 to sites</h2>

<p>There won’t be any legal requirements to follow this new draft version for quite a while. That said, the new guidelines are so good they are well worth implementing and testing for right away.</p>

<p>WCAG 2.1 is a good baseline, but there are a lot of areas where it falls short and we should aim beyond. To illustrate – here is a color contrast fail, generated with <a href="https://whocanuse.com/">Who Can Use</a>. According to WCAG 2.1 rules, the black text would be higher-contrast over this shade of blue than white text:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wcag-22-accessibility-guidelines/whocanuse-blue.png" alt="Comparison of lorem copy in white and black, over a blue background (hex code #2E7CD6). White has a contrast ratio of 4.23:1, non-compliant, black has 4.97:1, passing level AA." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparison of lorem copy in white and black, over a blue background (hex code #2E7CD6). White has a contrast ratio of 4.23:1, non-compliant, black has 4.97:1, passing level AA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is due to how basic the contrast calculations are in WCAG 2.1. This specific issue will – hopefully – be addressed in the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/">WCAG 3.0</a>. It’s still a very early draft, but is well worth being aware of as well if you’re critically thinking of where else WCAG 2.1 might be falling short.</p>

<p>I think the most problematic issue was with the animating banner on Safari, which made it completely impossible to navigate the page with a screen reader. Other than this, most issues were relatively minor.</p>

<p>The main issues I didn’t get to are the ones with buttons / links – the fact having disabled buttons is confusing, and that there are lots of contrast issues with those disabled styles. The focus styles also have poor contrast for the buttons that are focusable.</p>

<p>My recommended fix for these would be to completely remove any button that’s currently disabled from the page, so there is no confusion.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-011515">TL;DR; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=4515s">01:15:15</a></h2>

<p>TL;DR; in video form: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=4515s">01:15:15</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Most issues come from Django for the UI, and the RTD theme for the documentation</li>
  <li>Great effort on translations and RTL support! It’s wonderful to see this being done as a baseline</li>
  <li>Very semantic tables markup, which definitely matters for the metrics’ display</li>
  <li>Some issues from this package with dark mode support, which make the library potentially unusable for dark mode users. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/59">#59</a>.</li>
  <li>There are a few improvements for screen reader users to be done here and there</li>
  <li>Table sorting was particularly hard to follow with a screen reader, although I suspect this is the Django implementation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-the-audit-000105">About the audit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=65s">00:01:05</a></h2>

<p>Scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML templates in GitHub</li>
  <li>UI in the Django admin (minimal customisations)</li>
  <li>Documentation in README</li>
  <li>Documentation in Read the Docs (default sphinx-rtd theme)</li>
</ul>

<p>Methodology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automated tests with Accessibility Insights with Chrome</li>
  <li>Keyboard navigation (tab stops)</li>
  <li>Color contrast</li>
  <li>Dark mode support</li>
  <li>RTL support</li>
  <li>Mobile support</li>
  <li>Screen reader navigation (VoiceOver in Safari)</li>
  <li>Other things picked up along the way</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="html-templates-000222">HTML templates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=142s">00:02:22</a></h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a lot of links with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute being used in. This can be announced multiple times by some screen readers, so I would suggest not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> wherever it matches the visible label of the link</li>
  <li>Table markup for the navigation in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> looks great, however this would be much quicker to navigate with a screen reader by using simpler markup, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ul</code> with a list item for each link.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table.html</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the breadcrumb in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav aria-label="Breadcrumbs"&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code> landmark, so screen reader users can bypass it or reach it more easily</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-current="page"</code> to the current page so it’s announced as such. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ui-000738">UI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=458s">00:07:38</a></h2>

<h3 id="automated-tests-with-accessibility-insights-with-chrome">Automated tests with Accessibility Insights with Chrome</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A lot of color contrast issues, but I believe they all come from Django itself</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard-navigation-001235">Keyboard navigation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=755s">00:12:35</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Missing a skip link on all pages – Django issue</li>
  <li>On metric pages, I found it a bit odd how the tab focus moves from the breadcrumb, to the package’s nav to the right, and then back to the metrics on the left. It’d be better to go straight from breadcrumb to the metrics’ tables.</li>
  <li>Likely a Django issue – the tab order for sorting is unexpected (right-to-left)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="color-contrast">Color contrast</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In the package’s views in the “POSTGRESQL METRICS” nav, there isn’t enough contrast between the “active” menu item and the other ones, so people won’t be able to tell which menu item is active. This is both for the text, and the “selected” indicator”. I would suggest adding an underline to the text. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=1584s">00:26:24</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dark-mode-001603">Dark mode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=963s">00:16:03</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>None of the package’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ok</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">warning</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">critical</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">info</code> states work in dark mode. They make the table’s contents completely unreadable. A solution would be to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code> styles like Django does, however I would recommend another approach that doesn’t rely on background color as the color also won’t be picked up by blind users – it’d be better to represent those 4 states with an icon, that could then have a text alternative, or just a label. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/59">#59</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Illustration:</p>

The rows aren’t readable" /></a></p>

<h3 id="rtl-support-001920">RTL support <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=1160s">00:19:20</a></h3>

<p>😐 I did all of my testing without having configured the language in Django settings, forgetting Django uses this to set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LANGUAGE_BIDI</code> and load the correct stylesheet. As far as I can tell there are no issues here!</p>

<h3 id="mobile-support-002415">Mobile support <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=1455s">00:24:15</a></h3>

<p>(this is more “small browser” support really, I didn’t do any touch navigation testing)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urlize</code>d links cause the page to overflow and scroll in 2 directions at once. That’s bad. For this, and for screen readers, I’d recommend using proper link labels.</li>
  <li>Tables also cause the page to overflow and scroll in 2 directions. It would be better if they overflowed the page but the overflow was scrollable for the table separately (wrap the table in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overflow: scroll</code>).</li>
  <li>With the way tables resize currently, they cause some of the cells with long values to reflow, which makes big numbers harder to read in my opinion. Scroll would be better in this instance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="screen-reader-navigation-voiceover-with-safari-003000">Screen reader navigation (VoiceOver with Safari) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=1800s">00:30:00</a></h3>

<p>Dashboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Django issue – the views should be using ARIA landmarks to facilitate navigation.</li>
  <li>Prefer displaying “POSTGRESQL METRICS” in TitleCase or lowercase as much as possible, rather than uppercase, as TTS is prone to mispronounce PostgreSQL if it’s all uppercase.</li>
  <li>The “show” link need a more descriptive label for screen reader users (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code>) so they can be understood without the visual context the links are in on the page. Alternatively, remove those links, as they do the same thing as the link next to them that has a better label already. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
  <li>Django issue – duplicate h1 heading</li>
</ul>

<p>Metrics views:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All of the custom views are missing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code> matching the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=915s">00:15:15</a>. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
  <li>Prefer to use links with human-friendly labels over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urlize</code> URLs. These don’t announce very well with screen reader text-to-speech unless the user knows how to navigate word-by-word or character-by-character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=678s">00:11:18</a></li>
  <li>Django issue (?) I found the table ordering to be very confusing</li>
  <li>Consider adding spaces around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> signs in table captions so screen readers TTS have a better chance of pronouncing the text correctly</li>
  <li>Currently the warning/info/ok/critical status are invisible for screen reader users. I’d suggesting adding a screen-reader only label, or an icon + label</li>
  <li>Some of the larger numbers in the tables are pronounced as identifiers (“one three five”) rather than numbers (“one hundred thirty five”). Consider adding numeric separators to make numbers more readable for humans and text-to-speech.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-things-picked-up-along-the-way">Other things picked up along the way</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The bigger values in tables are picked up by my browser as telephone numbers. This might warrant a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no"/&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="docs-in-readme-005315">Docs in README <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pegTdRaUDg&amp;t=3195s">00:53:15</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>The project’s name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">django-postgres-metrics</code> is being read letter-by-letter by VoiceOver, unless I manually switch to word-by-word navigation. In the main heading, I would suggest switching to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Django Postgres Metrics</code> to make it more likely for people to understand what the project is.</li>
  <li>The badges’ alt text should match the text on the images. This is likely impossible, but I’d suggest changing alt text to match the visible text more closely. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
  <li>Python and Django versions badges should link to some place those versions are available in text format (or add the versions hard-coded in the alt text). Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
  <li>It would be nice to use more descriptive alt text for the screenshot. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
  <li>The “AT” and “DOT” in the email address are read as acronyms. Would be nice to replace with lowercase variants so they are read as words. Fixed in <a href="https://github.com/django-postgres-metrics/django-postgres-metrics/pull/58">#58</a>.</li>
