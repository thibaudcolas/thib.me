<!-- more -->

<p>TL;DR; from my perspective as a maintainer and user of this mirror, it’s working great and is better by all my personal measures than an equivalent install from the main project.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It’s taken me about 1h of maintenance since initial setup. The main thing I did is writing this report, and adjusting the frequency of the mirroring script a couple times due to concerns with its energy usage.</li>
  <li>No one has opened any issues in the mirror repository. As far as I can tell no one has reported problems with the mirror elsewhere either.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The script takes on average 20s to run, and did so 3 times per week for the last 12+ months. So over that year and a bit that’s somewhere around 1h of run time.</li>
  <li>Since initial setup, the mirror has published 38 versions of Stylelint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a graph from GitHub which shows commits – i.e. when versions were published over the last few months:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maintaining-the-pre-commit-stylelint-mirror/pre-commit-stylelint-mirror-publish.png" alt="pre-commit-stylelint mirror publish" /></p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>According to GitHub statistics, on average 42 people or CI builds use this mirror (clone the repository) per day</li>
  <li>On average there are 133 clones of the repository per day.</li>
  <li>According to the same stats, less than 1 person looks at the project in GitHub per day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the full statistics I have access to as of today:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maintaining-the-pre-commit-stylelint-mirror/pre-commit-stylelint-mirror-usage.png" alt="pre-commit-stylelint mirror statistics" /></p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>

<p>Last year I compared the <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1768#issuecomment-1032701216">performance of installing ESLint via a mirror vs. the base repository</a>. For that package, the mirror was about 8x faster (7s vs. a minute). If we used those numbers to assess how much processing the mirror has saved – that’d be a lower bound of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7s per use * 42 users per day * 365 days</code> per year: 30 hours, vs.  255 hours if the same amount of usage had happened via installs of the repository directly.</p>

<p>Again this is mixing <em>ESLint</em> installation times with Stylelint usage figures, so not really correct by any means, but is a good indication the 1h the mirror runs per year is well worth the time and energy saved for everyone. If I calculate this again in the future I’ll also look at memory usage.</p>]]></content><author><name>Thibaud Colas</name></author><category term="Open Source" /><category term="Report" /><category term="Tools" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a year and a half after set up pre-commit-stylelint, I thought I’d quickly look into how well this mirror has been running.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DjangoCon Europe 2023 – Accessibility review of djangoproject.com</title><link href="https://thib.me/djangocon-europe-2023-accessibility-review-of-djangoproject-com" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DjangoCon Europe 2023 – Accessibility review of djangoproject.com" /><published>2023-06-02T21:13:03+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-02T21:13:03+00:00</updated><id>https://thib.me/djangocon-europe-2023-accessibility-review-of-djangoproject-com</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thib.me/djangocon-europe-2023-accessibility-review-of-djangoproject-com"><![CDATA[<p>Here are the results of a quick accessibility audit I did for the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django project website</a>, as part of the DjangoCon Europe 2023 sprints.</p>

<p>I recorded myself going through this and put it up on YouTube, so we have a demo for each of the issues: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U">djangoproject.com accessibility testing - DjangoCon Europe 2023</a>. I’ve also reported the issues in the project’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/issues/1381">Accessibility issues with site design and implementation #1381</a>.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>TL;DW; There are pretty fundamental issues, that aren’t always blockers but would require widespread changes to address: keyboard support, color contrast, use of headings. My recommended highest-priority changes are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new top-level navigation, including keyboard support fixes.</li>
  <li>Changes to the main content layout for easier navigation to important links.</li>
  <li>A new color palette with more legible text.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Here is a detailed list of issues I spotted, split into the categories I normally use, with links to my testing video’s timestamps, WCAG success criteria, and existing GitHub issues where appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="blockers">Blockers</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blocker: Critical issue. Certain users cannot perceive or operate this, with no workaround available.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The “hamburger” menu toggle is impossible to use with a keyboard. This makes it impossible for keyboard and screen reader users to access menu items and navigate the site in this way. (<a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/issues/1234">Menu button is not a button #1234</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1098s">18:18</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard">SC 2.1.1 Keyboard</a>).</li>
  <li>The page’s second column content is hidden in print stylesheets. This makes it impossible for users of magnifiers to access this content (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1320s">22:00</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="major">Major</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Major: Certain users are very likely to have difficulty perceiving or operating this.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Heading level 1 should be used for the title of the page / visually most prominent heading, ideally not for invisible content (“Django” on homepage). Ideally each page would only have a single h1. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=424s">07:04</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="confusing">Confusing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Confusing: Understanding or operating this may be difficult for some users.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Focus style almost invisible on “Get started with Django” CTA (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=150s">02:30</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-contrast">SC 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast</a>).</li>
  <li>Links should be identifiable with other means than color (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=330s">05:30</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color">SC 1.4.1 Use of Color</a>).</li>
  <li>All page content should be in a landmark (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=579s">09:39</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>).</li>
  <li>A lot of text has color contrast issues making it hard to read (<a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/issues/974">#974</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=788s">13:08</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>).</li>
  <li>Scrolling should remain vertical only (no overflows) when using 400% page zoom (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1008s">16:48</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow">SC 1.4.10 Reflow</a>).</li>
  <li>Website logo disappears in forced colors mode with a light theme (white on white) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1154s">19:14</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minor">Minor</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minor: Degraded user experience for some users. This slows down use of the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Missing skip link (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=42s">00:42</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks">SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a>).</li>
  <li>Custom “dotted outline” focus styles: not visible enough and broken in main navigation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=62s">01:02</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-appearance">SC 2.4.13 Focus Appearance</a>).</li>
  <li>The two-column layout as implemented means reaching the second column content with the keyboard requires going through the entire first column (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=178s">02:58</a>, see also <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/issues/494">#494</a>).</li>
  <li>The sidebar heading hierarchy makes it hard to understand the content structure (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=424s">07:04</a>).</li>
  <li>Keep uppercase text to a minimum. Can be problematic to read for some people, shouty, leads to pronounciation issues with screen readers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=940s">15:40</a>).</li>
  <li>Avoid interactive elements going right up to the edge of the screen on smaller viewports (“Get started with Django” button), as it makes it hard for touch users to touch-scroll past those elements (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1050s">17:30</a>).</li>
  <li>For forced colors mode compatibility, show the regions of the page with borders since backgrounds are removed (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1180s">19:40</a>).</li>
  <li>For forced colors mode compatibility, show the outline of buttons with borders since backgrounds are removed (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1180s">19:40</a>).</li>
  <li>Form fields should remain visible in print stylesheets so the page content is understandable (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1340s">22:20</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Best practices: These are not accessibility issues, but are recommended for ensuring the best user experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The theme toggle’s icon should resize according to browser font size changes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=920s">15:20</a>).</li>
  <li>Footer logos should also ideally resize according to browser font size changes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=920s">15:20</a>).</li>
  <li>Hide the theme toggle in print styles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1265s">21:05</a>).</li>
  <li>Have link URLs visible in print styles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1265s">21:05</a>).</li>
  <li>Hide footer content in print styles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMPTOMh1U&amp;t=1265s">21:05</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>In the interest of time, I only reviewed the site with a suite of automated and semi-automated checks available in Google Chrome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axe automated checks bundled in the <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">Accessibility Insights extension</a>.</li>
  <li>Other tools from Accessibility Insights: Landmarks, Color, Tab stops, Headings, Accessible names</li>
  <li>Simulated <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/">forced colors mode</a></li>
  <li>Font resizing and page zoom</li>
  <li>Keyboard navigation</li>
</ul>

<p>Though those tests will find a lot of common issues, normally accessibility testing would include navigating the site with assistive technologies (screen readers, speech recognition, screen magnification, etc).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="accessibility-checks-on-wagtail-sites">Accessibility checks on Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>Here are 4 common issues detectable with our built-in checker:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/accessibility_checks_on_wagtail_sites.png" alt="Accessibility checks on Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2023 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>button-name</strong>: A button element on the page is lacking a label. This is entirely detectable with automated tests such as those featured in our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/introducing-wagtails-new-accessibility-checker/">built-in accessibility checker</a>, built on Axe.</li>
  <li><strong>frame-title</strong>: A frame (such as an embedded video) is missing its title. Again entirely detectable with automated tests – and very simple to fix once identified!</li>
  <li><strong>heading-order</strong>: Some heading levels are getting skipped on the page – always have a main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>link-name</strong>: Just like button-name, one of the page’s links is missing its title.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those issues are <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility#heading-hierarchy">common on the web</a>, but with the right tests in place, there is no reason for that to remain the case.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Here is the data for this graph: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLpW6fbcl-AsVQNVhihzi1p-fY5gByZK_EQWt-EtCoM/edit#gid=316824519">Lighthouse checks, 2023-04</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="mean-accessibility-scores-of-wagtail-sites">Mean accessibility scores of Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>We see clear improvements over time on accessibility scores of Wagtail sites, but they’re too slow-moving:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/mean_accessibility_scores_of_wagtail_sites.png" alt="Mean accessibility scores of Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive sites in 2023 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<p>This shows the mean accessibility score of Wagtail sites over time, compared to <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility#introduction">industry-average figures</a>. Wagtail sites are consistently doing better – but only just.</p>

<p>With appropriate targets and ongoing testing, there is no reason all sites couldn’t score a perfect “100” (no issues detected) on those tests.</p>

<h2 id="high-contrast-mode-support-in-wagtail-sites">High contrast mode support in Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>#GAAD tip #3: Support High contrast mode on your websites! Also known as Contrast themes, it allows users to adjust the color palette of the site to better suit their vision. Very few websites make adjustments to support it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/high_contrast_mode_support_in_Wagtail_sites.png" alt="High contrast mode support in Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2022-07 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>“forced-colors” indicates a website making adjustments for users with custom color palettes – for example adding extra borders</li>
  <li>“prefers-contrast” indicates a website adjusting its styles based on whether users request more or <em>less</em> contrast, which is an option in iOS and Android</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve made a lot of adjustments in recent versions of Wagtail to better support Contrast Themes / High contrast mode. Here’s an example in the default dark theme:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/whcm-wagtail-5.png" alt="Wagtail's page editing UI in high contrast mode, with completely custom colors" /></p>

<h2 id="wagtail-sites-with-no-detected-issues">Wagtail sites with no detected issues</h2>

<p>Aim higher with all things accessibility. Wagtail sites are doing better year over year, but there’s still lots to do:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/wagtail_sites_with_no_detected_issues.png" alt="Wagtail sites with no detected issues - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2023 vs 2022 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<p>We found 4.44% of Wagtail sites had no issues detected in 2023, compared to 3.83% in 2022. Those numbers are <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">above industry averages</a> but nowhere near our ambitions. All sites can score a perfect “0 errors” detected - and then further spend time on manual tests which can also uncover fundamental issues.</p>

<p>We hope our commitment to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG 2.0 standard</a> will help all Wagtail sites get there, with tools like our accessibility checker paving the way.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As Wagtail took off as a project, it became crystal clear it would be popular. Not necessarily as popular as the most established CMS options (yet!), but still powering serious websites on the web. This popularity comes with a responsibility: for us to acknowledge Wagtail websites do have a clear carbon footprint in their operations. Those digital emissions contribute to the climate change impact of the digital world. This acknowledgement is the foundation of <a href="https://wagtail.org/sustainability/">our commitment to sustainability</a>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4">current research</a>, emissions from Information and Communication Technologies represent on the order of 2 to 4% of global emissions (similar to major countries or transportation industries). And they’re projected significantly in the future. Let’s do our best to estimate Wagtail’s footprint within those numbers – so we can reduce it.</p>

<h2 id="our-preferred-methodology">Our preferred methodology</h2>

<p>Due to how carbon emissions originate at all points in the value chain of software, it can be very hard to estimate them accurately. We chose a methodology which makes up for its lack of precision by being very established and simple to apply: the <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/">Sustainable Web Design model</a>. This is the model used by a lot of online calculators, such as <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology clearly specifies two fundamentals decisions when estimating emissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What to measure</strong> – often referred to as “system boundaries” or segments. This can be <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-consumption/">very complex on the web</a>, where the fundamental website visitor experience involves a lot of infrastructure and devices, with different ownership structures.</li>
  <li><strong>How to measure it</strong> – practically, how to compute emissions once the system boundaries are agreed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-boundaries">System boundaries</h3>

<p>Here are the system boundaries as defined by this methodology:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/swd-energy-usage.png" alt="How the Sustainable Web Design model allocates energy usage" /></p>

<p><em>Image credit:</em> <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/explainer/methodologies-for-calculating-website-carbon/"><em>Green Web Foundation, CO2.js</em></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer device use</strong>: end users interacting with a product or service. This accounts for an estimated 52% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Network use</strong>: data transferred across the network. This accounts for an estimated 14% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Data center use</strong>: energy required to house and serve data. This accounts for an estimated 15% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware production</strong>: embodied energy used in the creation of embedded chips, use of data centers, use of networks, and the use of consumer communication devices. This accounts for an estimated 19% of the system. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="estimation-approach">Estimation approach</h3>

<p>With system boundaries now defined, the model then defines how to measure energy usage (and therefore emissions) with one key metric: data transferred, in kWh/GB. The more data is stored, manipulated, transferred over the network, displayed on a page – the more emissions.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.fershad.com/writing/is-data-the-best-proxy-for-website-carbon-emissions/">clear flaws with this approach</a>: different types of data will be more or less taxing on different parts of the system. It’s nonetheless a good starting approximation because of how simple it is to measure the size of website pages.</p>

<h3 id="more-precise-measurements">More precise measurements</h3>

<p>With the help of the Green Coding Berlin group and the Green Web Foundation, we’ve also been exploring much more precise measurements as part of the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843">Green coding</a> project. With their technology, we can measure detailed power consumption of specific components as a simulated user interacts with the site:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/green-coding-chart.png" alt="Green coding chart" /></p>

<p>Here, we see how different parts of a website’s infrastructure consume more or less energy as part of specific aspects of serving pages.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those measurements have the potential to allow us to quantify specific improvements to the CMS, therefore improving our ability to influence Wagtail websites’ footprint in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-the-wagtail-web">Measuring the Wagtail web</h2>

<p>To apply our chosen methodology to Wagtail websites, out there, we can use publicly-available data: the Chrome UX Report (CrUX), HTTP Archive, and Wappalyzer. This is the same methodology as devised for the HTTP Archive’s yearly Web Almanac report, which had a <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability">Sustainability chapter</a> for the first time in 2022.</p>

<p>With those datasets of websites’ homepages, as of April 2023, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4349 websites reported as using Wagtail</strong></li>
  <li>For those websites, a <strong>median page weight of 1.9 MB</strong>. This is higher than we’d like but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/page-weight#request-bytes">in line with industry averages</a>.</li>
  <li>Emissions per page visit on the order of 0.5 to 1.5 grams of CO2 equivalent per page view (gCO2e/pageview)</li>
  <li><strong>Average emissions per site around 1.9 tCO2e/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all – <strong>a total of 8240 tons of CO2e/year for all 4349 Wagtail sites</strong>. Though also in line with <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#carbon-emissions">industry average carbon emissions data</a>, this is an uncomfortable figure nonetheless. Which we now have to work to reduce.</p>

<p>Here is what those emissions look like as a tree map, with specific sites or countries sized according to their emissions:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/total_carbon_footprint_of_Wagtail_sites_as_a_treemap.png" alt="Total carbon footprint of Wagtail sites as a treemap - 8240 tCO2e per year" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/google-season-of-docs-creating-wagtail-developer-onboarding-tutorials/seasonofdocs-visual.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This year, after a successful experience working with technical writers <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/our-very-first-outreachy-interns/">as part of Outreachy</a>, we’ve decided to take part in <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs">Google Season of Docs</a>. We’re aiming to create more comprehensive onboarding tutorials for developers, and get better at how we engage with technical writers in our community.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-google-season-of-docs">What is Google Season of Docs</h2>

<p>Google Season of Docs (or GSoD) is an annual program organized by Google to support open source projects improving their documentation, and to give professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. The program pairs writers with organizations to collaborate on specific documentation projects. It fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and appreciation for the essential role of documentation in software development.</p>

<p>This year, Google selected <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants">13 organisations</a> to support.</p>

<h2 id="why-were-taking-part">Why we’re taking part</h2>

<p>There are several reasons we decided to participate in GSoD this year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve our “getting started” documentation: We recognize that comprehensive, well-written documentation is crucial for the adoption and growth of any software project. Improving the “first thirty minutes of Wagtail” has been <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtail-vision/">part of our vision</a> for Wagtail in 2023 – focusing on the next few steps in developers’ onboarding feels natural.</li>
  <li>Learn from experienced technical writers: Collaboration with skilled technical writers brings fresh perspectives and insights that help us enhance our documentation processes and overall project communication. We got to see this happening for <a href="https://guide.wagtail.org/">guide.wagtail.org</a> during Outreachy, and are hoping to do the same for developer docs.</li>
  <li>Build relationships with the community: We hope GSoD will be a good opportunity to see how our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtails-new-developer-relations-team/">new Developer Relations team</a> operates. Building developer tutorials will be a good opportunity to reach out to our community for feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="our-project">Our project</h2>

<p>Here is what we expect the project to consist of at this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audit the existing Wagtail Get Started tutorial and create a friction log to ensure it is accessible and usable for newcomers.</li>
  <li>Use the friction log to update our primary tutorial and ensure it provides a strong basis for additional learning in the onboarding tutorial series.</li>
  <li>Review the Wagtail Bakery, an existing demo project used for teaching and testing, to determine which Wagtail features should be covered in the tutorials.</li>
  <li>Use the audit results to create a series of written tutorials for our documentation that teach newcomers how to build their own deployable Wagtail website using the newest version of Wagtail.</li>
  <li>Work with our community organisers to adapt the tutorials for open source beginners, which will support programs and workshops like Outreachy, GSoC, and Coders of Colour.</li>
  <li>Incorporate feedback from tutorial testers and the wider community.</li>
  <li>Work with the Wagtail core team to update our documentation and determine a process for maintaining the written tutorials going forward.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with our Developer Relations team to identify the best opportunities to share the tutorial with our community at upcoming events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<!-- more -->

<p>We’re now kickstarting a new developer relations team for Wagtail, to oversee how we engage with our community of developers. Sounds interesting? Consider joining!</p>

<h2 id="developer-relations">Developer relations</h2>

<p>As a general term, Developer Relations (or DevRel) is an umbrella term covering the relationships between Wagtail and developers within the project’s community. This encompasses marketing, training, community management, and other community-focused activities.</p>

<p>In the case of Wagtail – this could mean helping with our <a href="https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/">docs.wagtail.org</a> documentation site, or helping organise events such as <a href="https://www.wagtail.space/">Wagtail Space</a>. Or simply contributing developer experience focused improvements to the CMS.</p>

<h2 id="team-project-ideas">Team project ideas</h2>

<p>We’ve discussed a few project ideas that feel relevant already, though the team will decide for themselves once up and running:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining ready-to-use Wagtail tutorials or workshops – our current “Getting started” tutorial works well but is very short.</li>
  <li>Supporting Wagtail Space events – working with local organisers to make those events simpler to set up and run.</li>
  <li>Helping produce feature videos – to share the latest improvements made to the CMS.</li>
  <li>“Pitch Wagtail to your boss” slide deck – to describe Wagtail to stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Developer experience survey – helping us understand what capabilities would be most desirable to our main audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>

<p>If you want to help shape Wagtail’s future, consider joining for the initial 6-month membership! All backgrounds and levels of expertise welcome. In particular, we hope this team will work well for people who don’t code and still want to contribute to open source.</p>

<p>To join, come say hi in #developer-relations on the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/slack">Wagtail Slack</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Thibaud Colas</name></author><category term="Wagtail" /><category term="Outreach" /><category term="Community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re setting up a new contributors team for people interested in developer relations.]]></summary></entry></feed>
