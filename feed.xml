<h2 id="accessibility-checks-on-wagtail-sites">Accessibility checks on Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>Here are 4 common issues detectable with our built-in checker:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/accessibility_checks_on_wagtail_sites.png" alt="Accessibility checks on Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2023 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>button-name</strong>: A button element on the page is lacking a label. This is entirely detectable with automated tests such as those featured in our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/introducing-wagtails-new-accessibility-checker/">built-in accessibility checker</a>, built on Axe.</li>
  <li><strong>frame-title</strong>: A frame (such as an embedded video) is missing its title. Again entirely detectable with automated tests – and very simple to fix once identified!</li>
  <li><strong>heading-order</strong>: Some heading levels are getting skipped on the page – always have a main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>link-name</strong>: Just like button-name, one of the page’s links is missing its title.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those issues are <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility#heading-hierarchy">common on the web</a>, but with the right tests in place, there is no reason for that to remain the case.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Here is the data for this graph: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLpW6fbcl-AsVQNVhihzi1p-fY5gByZK_EQWt-EtCoM/edit#gid=316824519">Lighthouse checks, 2023-04</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="mean-accessibility-scores-of-wagtail-sites">Mean accessibility scores of Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>We see clear improvements over time on accessibility scores of Wagtail sites, but they’re too slow-moving:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/mean_accessibility_scores_of_wagtail_sites.png" alt="Mean accessibility scores of Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive sites in 2023 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<p>This shows the mean accessibility score of Wagtail sites over time, compared to <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility#introduction">industry-average figures</a>. Wagtail sites are consistently doing better – but only just.</p>

<p>With appropriate targets and ongoing testing, there is no reason all sites couldn’t score a perfect “100” (no issues detected) on those tests.</p>

<h2 id="high-contrast-mode-support-in-wagtail-sites">High contrast mode support in Wagtail sites</h2>

<p>#GAAD tip #3: Support High contrast mode on your websites! Also known as Contrast themes, it allows users to adjust the color palette of the site to better suit their vision. Very few websites make adjustments to support it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/high_contrast_mode_support_in_Wagtail_sites.png" alt="High contrast mode support in Wagtail sites - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2022-07 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>“forced-colors” indicates a website making adjustments for users with custom color palettes – for example adding extra borders</li>
  <li>“prefers-contrast” indicates a website adjusting its styles based on whether users request more or <em>less</em> contrast, which is an option in iOS and Android</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve made a lot of adjustments in recent versions of Wagtail to better support Contrast Themes / High contrast mode. Here’s an example in the default dark theme:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/whcm-wagtail-5.png" alt="Wagtail's page editing UI in high contrast mode, with completely custom colors" /></p>

<h2 id="wagtail-sites-with-no-detected-issues">Wagtail sites with no detected issues</h2>

<p>Aim higher with all things accessibility. Wagtail sites are doing better year over year, but there’s still lots to do:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/wagtail-accessibility-statistics-for-gaad-2023/wagtail_sites_with_no_detected_issues.png" alt="Wagtail sites with no detected issues - HTTP Archive Wagtail sites in 2023 vs 2022 - GAAD 2023" /></p>

<p>We found 4.44% of Wagtail sites had no issues detected in 2023, compared to 3.83% in 2022. Those numbers are <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">above industry averages</a> but nowhere near our ambitions. All sites can score a perfect “0 errors” detected - and then further spend time on manual tests which can also uncover fundamental issues.</p>

<p>We hope our commitment to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG 2.0 standard</a> will help all Wagtail sites get there, with tools like our accessibility checker paving the way.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-methodology">Data and methodology</h2>

<p>The data we use comes from a dataset of the world’s top 8M website homepages: <a href="https://httparchive.org/">HTTP Archive</a>. 4,000+ websites in this dataset are identified as using Wagtail, thanks to <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/">Wappalyzer</a>.</p>

<p>From this dataset, we then extract specific statistics following the methodology of the <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/accessibility">2022 HTTP Archive Web Almanac’s accessibility chapter</a> – but filtering to only assess Wagtail projects.</p>]]></content><author><name>Thibaud Colas</name></author><category term="Accessibility" /><category term="Report" /><category term="Wagtail" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of #GAAD, this week we’re sharing accessibility stats &amp; tips from Wagtail sites.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Estimating Wagtail websites’ emissions</title><link href="https://thib.me/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Estimating Wagtail websites’ emissions" /><published>2023-05-10T18:39:03+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-10T18:39:03+00:00</updated><id>https://thib.me/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thib.me/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions"><![CDATA[<p>Wagtail’s approach to quantifying the carbon footprint of Wagtail websites, so we can reduce it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As Wagtail took off as a project, it became crystal clear it would be popular. Not necessarily as popular as the most established CMS options (yet!), but still powering serious websites on the web. This popularity comes with a responsibility: for us to acknowledge Wagtail websites do have a clear carbon footprint in their operations. Those digital emissions contribute to the climate change impact of the digital world. This acknowledgement is the foundation of <a href="https://wagtail.org/sustainability/">our commitment to sustainability</a>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4">current research</a>, emissions from Information and Communication Technologies represent on the order of 2 to 4% of global emissions (similar to major countries or transportation industries). And they’re projected significantly in the future. Let’s do our best to estimate Wagtail’s footprint within those numbers – so we can reduce it.</p>

<h2 id="our-preferred-methodology">Our preferred methodology</h2>

<p>Due to how carbon emissions originate at all points in the value chain of software, it can be very hard to estimate them accurately. We chose a methodology which makes up for its lack of precision by being very established and simple to apply: the <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/">Sustainable Web Design model</a>. This is the model used by a lot of online calculators, such as <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology clearly specifies two fundamentals decisions when estimating emissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What to measure</strong> – often referred to as “system boundaries” or segments. This can be <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-consumption/">very complex on the web</a>, where the fundamental website visitor experience involves a lot of infrastructure and devices, with different ownership structures.</li>
  <li><strong>How to measure it</strong> – practically, how to compute emissions once the system boundaries are agreed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-boundaries">System boundaries</h3>

<p>Here are the system boundaries as defined by this methodology:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/swd-energy-usage.png" alt="How the Sustainable Web Design model allocates energy usage" /></p>

<p><em>Image credit:</em> <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/explainer/methodologies-for-calculating-website-carbon/"><em>Green Web Foundation, CO2.js</em></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer device use</strong>: end users interacting with a product or service. This accounts for an estimated 52% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Network use</strong>: data transferred across the network. This accounts for an estimated 14% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Data center use</strong>: energy required to house and serve data. This accounts for an estimated 15% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware production</strong>: embodied energy used in the creation of embedded chips, use of data centers, use of networks, and the use of consumer communication devices. This accounts for an estimated 19% of the system. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="estimation-approach">Estimation approach</h3>

<p>With system boundaries now defined, the model then defines how to measure energy usage (and therefore emissions) with one key metric: data transferred, in kWh/GB. The more data is stored, manipulated, transferred over the network, displayed on a page – the more emissions.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.fershad.com/writing/is-data-the-best-proxy-for-website-carbon-emissions/">clear flaws with this approach</a>: different types of data will be more or less taxing on different parts of the system. It’s nonetheless a good starting approximation because of how simple it is to measure the size of website pages.</p>

<h3 id="more-precise-measurements">More precise measurements</h3>

<p>With the help of the Green Coding Berlin group and the Green Web Foundation, we’ve also been exploring much more precise measurements as part of the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843">Green coding</a> project. With their technology, we can measure detailed power consumption of specific components as a simulated user interacts with the site:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/green-coding-chart.png" alt="Green coding chart" /></p>

<p>Here, we see how different parts of a website’s infrastructure consume more or less energy as part of specific aspects of serving pages.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those measurements have the potential to allow us to quantify specific improvements to the CMS, therefore improving our ability to influence Wagtail websites’ footprint in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-the-wagtail-web">Measuring the Wagtail web</h2>

<p>To apply our chosen methodology to Wagtail websites, out there, we can use publicly-available data: the Chrome UX Report (CrUX), HTTP Archive, and Wappalyzer. This is the same methodology as devised for the HTTP Archive’s yearly Web Almanac report, which had a <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability">Sustainability chapter</a> for the first time in 2022.</p>

<p>With those datasets of websites’ homepages, as of April 2023, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4349 websites reported as using Wagtail</strong></li>
  <li>For those websites, a <strong>median page weight of 1.9 MB</strong>. This is higher than we’d like but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/page-weight#request-bytes">in line with industry averages</a>.</li>
  <li>Emissions per page visit on the order of 0.5 to 1.5 grams of CO2 equivalent per page view (gCO2e/pageview)</li>
  <li><strong>Average emissions per site around 1.9 tCO2e/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all – <strong>a total of 8240 tons of CO2e/year for all 4349 Wagtail sites</strong>. Though also in line with <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#carbon-emissions">industry average carbon emissions data</a>, this is an uncomfortable figure nonetheless. Which we now have to work to reduce.</p>

<p>Here is what those emissions look like as a tree map, with specific sites or countries sized according to their emissions:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/total_carbon_footprint_of_Wagtail_sites_as_a_treemap.png" alt="Total carbon footprint of Wagtail sites as a treemap - 8240 tCO2e per year" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/google-season-of-docs-creating-wagtail-developer-onboarding-tutorials/seasonofdocs-visual.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This year, after a successful experience working with technical writers <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/our-very-first-outreachy-interns/">as part of Outreachy</a>, we’ve decided to take part in <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs">Google Season of Docs</a>. We’re aiming to create more comprehensive onboarding tutorials for developers, and get better at how we engage with technical writers in our community.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-google-season-of-docs">What is Google Season of Docs</h2>

<p>Google Season of Docs (or GSoD) is an annual program organized by Google to support open source projects improving their documentation, and to give professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. The program pairs writers with organizations to collaborate on specific documentation projects. It fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and appreciation for the essential role of documentation in software development.</p>

<p>This year, Google selected <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants">13 organisations</a> to support.</p>

<h2 id="why-were-taking-part">Why we’re taking part</h2>

<p>There are several reasons we decided to participate in GSoD this year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve our “getting started” documentation: We recognize that comprehensive, well-written documentation is crucial for the adoption and growth of any software project. Improving the “first thirty minutes of Wagtail” has been <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtail-vision/">part of our vision</a> for Wagtail in 2023 – focusing on the next few steps in developers’ onboarding feels natural.</li>
  <li>Learn from experienced technical writers: Collaboration with skilled technical writers brings fresh perspectives and insights that help us enhance our documentation processes and overall project communication. We got to see this happening for <a href="https://guide.wagtail.org/">guide.wagtail.org</a> during Outreachy, and are hoping to do the same for developer docs.</li>
  <li>Build relationships with the community: We hope GSoD will be a good opportunity to see how our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtails-new-developer-relations-team/">new Developer Relations team</a> operates. Building developer tutorials will be a good opportunity to reach out to our community for feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="our-project">Our project</h2>

<p>Here is what we expect the project to consist of at this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audit the existing Wagtail Get Started tutorial and create a friction log to ensure it is accessible and usable for newcomers.</li>
  <li>Use the friction log to update our primary tutorial and ensure it provides a strong basis for additional learning in the onboarding tutorial series.</li>
  <li>Review the Wagtail Bakery, an existing demo project used for teaching and testing, to determine which Wagtail features should be covered in the tutorials.</li>
  <li>Use the audit results to create a series of written tutorials for our documentation that teach newcomers how to build their own deployable Wagtail website using the newest version of Wagtail.</li>
  <li>Work with our community organisers to adapt the tutorials for open source beginners, which will support programs and workshops like Outreachy, GSoC, and Coders of Colour.</li>
  <li>Incorporate feedback from tutorial testers and the wider community.</li>
  <li>Work with the Wagtail core team to update our documentation and determine a process for maintaining the written tutorials going forward.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with our Developer Relations team to identify the best opportunities to share the tutorial with our community at upcoming events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>We’re <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2023#getting-involved">accepting applications</a> from technical writers until April 15th (reach out in the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">Wagtail Slack workspace</a> in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C051ERV9F9Q">#gsod channel</a> if you would welcome more time). We then hope to select a writer to work with by May 1st, and plan the next 6 months of work with them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We’re now kickstarting a new developer relations team for Wagtail, to oversee how we engage with our community of developers. Sounds interesting? Consider joining!</p>

<h2 id="developer-relations">Developer relations</h2>

<p>As a general term, Developer Relations (or DevRel) is an umbrella term covering the relationships between Wagtail and developers within the project’s community. This encompasses marketing, training, community management, and other community-focused activities.</p>

<p>In the case of Wagtail – this could mean helping with our <a href="https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/">docs.wagtail.org</a> documentation site, or helping organise events such as <a href="https://www.wagtail.space/">Wagtail Space</a>. Or simply contributing developer experience focused improvements to the CMS.</p>

<h2 id="team-project-ideas">Team project ideas</h2>

<p>We’ve discussed a few project ideas that feel relevant already, though the team will decide for themselves once up and running:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining ready-to-use Wagtail tutorials or workshops – our current “Getting started” tutorial works well but is very short.</li>
  <li>Supporting Wagtail Space events – working with local organisers to make those events simpler to set up and run.</li>
  <li>Helping produce feature videos – to share the latest improvements made to the CMS.</li>
  <li>“Pitch Wagtail to your boss” slide deck – to describe Wagtail to stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Developer experience survey – helping us understand what capabilities would be most desirable to our main audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>

<p>If you want to help shape Wagtail’s future, consider joining for the initial 6-month membership! All backgrounds and levels of expertise welcome. In particular, we hope this team will work well for people who don’t code and still want to contribute to open source.</p>

<p>To join, come say hi in #developer-relations on the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/slack">Wagtail Slack</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Thibaud Colas</name></author><category term="Wagtail" /><category term="Outreach" /><category term="Community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re setting up a new contributors team for people interested in developer relations.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wagtail CMS projects for Google Summer of Code 2023</title><link href="https://thib.me/wagtail-cms-projects-for-google-summer-of-code-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wagtail CMS projects for Google Summer of Code 2023" /><published>2023-02-22T18:50:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-22T18:50:00+00:00</updated><id>https://thib.me/wagtail-cms-projects-for-google-summer-of-code-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thib.me/wagtail-cms-projects-for-google-summer-of-code-2023"><![CDATA[<p>For the third time, Wagtail is joining Google’s open source internships program.</p>

<p>It’s official! Following our <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/">participation to Outreachy</a> in the December 2022 cohort, Wagtail is taking part in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-google-summer-of-code">What is Google Summer of Code</h2>

<p>Also known as GSoC, Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.</p>

<h2 id="project-ideas">Project ideas</h2>

<p>We’ve earmarked three project ideas this year.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme-for-wagtail-admin">Dark theme for Wagtail admin</h3>

<p><em>🚧 Update: we have discontinued this idea, as the work involved isn’t substantial enough to represent a GSoC project.</em></p>

<p>This is a continuation of past projects to make Wagtail’s color theme configurable, and accessibility improvements for Windows High Contrast mode users.</p>

<p>Here is the latest prototype of our dark theme, in a high contrast variant:</p>

<p>Wagtail currently doesn’t have a first-party solution for long-running tasks. Other CMSs in the ecosystem such as WordPress and Drupal have background workers, allowing them to push tasks into the background to be processed at a later date, without requiring the end user to wait for them to occur.</p>

<p>One of the key goals for this project is removing the requirement for the user to wait for tasks they don’t need to.</p>

<h3 id="greener-coding-wagtails-climate-impact">Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact</h3>

<p>We’re starting to have a better understanding of the<a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843">climate impact of Wagtail</a> as a CMS, and how we can reduce it. We want to integrate our findings into Wagtail’s direction, and make concrete improvements to the project to reduce related carbon emissions.</p>

<p>This project is part of a partnership with the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/">Green Web Foundation</a>, with mentors from both organisations.</p>

Last week we bought a new OLED TV, which is the first OLED device I’ve ever owned, so I finally got a chance to experience whether / how much that was true.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>So I tested <a href="https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/">guide.wagtail.org</a>, on which we recently added a dark theme, displaying the homepage with the TV plugged into a watt meter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With the light theme, the TV uses 63W.</li>
  <li>With the dark theme, it uses 34W.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a stark difference but it gets worse: this TV has lots of onboard processing, so turning off the panel itself with everything else on, the TV still consumes 31W. Which means the TV panel consumes 3W to display in the dark theme, and 33W, 10x more, to display the light theme.</p>

<p>This reduction in power consumption only applies to OLED devices, which have a limited market share but are getting more common.</p>

<h2 id="testing-a-real-world-website">Testing a real-world website</h2>

<p>The Wagtail user guide is a real production site but doesn’t necessarly represent a typical site: it’s text-heavy, even on its homepage. Let’s now try out <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/">rnib.org.uk</a>, for which my company recently implemented a dark theme.</p>

<p>Here’s the results on my TV:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/measuring-dark-mode-energy-savings/rnib-oled-energy.jpg" alt="Side-by-side shots of the RNIB website with a power meter in front. On the left is a light theme where the power meter says 59.1. On the right dark theme and the power meter says 35.8" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>With the light theme, the TV uses 59.1W.</li>
  <li>With the dark theme, the TV uses 35.8W.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the  same 31W for TV components other than the panel, this means a panel consumption of 28W for the light theme, and 4.8W for the dark theme. That’s a 83% reduction in power consumption.</p>

<p>And another example with Wagtail’s dark mode:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/measuring-dark-mode-energy-savings/energy-usage-dark-mode-wagtail.jpg" alt="Side-by-side shots of Wagtail in light and dark mode" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>With the light theme, the TV uses 57.0W.</li>
  <li>With the dark theme, the TV uses 33.4W.</li>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/outreachy-banner.jpg" alt="Outreachy - Internships supporting diversity in Free and Open Source Software" /></p>

<p>As an experienced open source contributor, onboarding newcomers into the world of open source is amongst the most rewarding tasks. After a successful participation to <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/google-summer-of-code-2022-wagtail-midterm/">this year’s Google Summer of Code</a>, we’re back at it already with <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>, joining their December 2022 cohort.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-outreachy">What is Outreachy</h2>

<p>Outreachy provides <strong>internships in open source and open science.</strong> The program provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by under-representation in the technical industry where they are living. Internships are fully remote, over 3 months, with interns receiving a fair stipend to support their work.</p>

<p>For Wagtail, this type of program is one of the best ways to work with more diverse contributors. We’re elated to have been selected, and hope we’ll get to work with between one and three new contributors this year.</p>

<h2 id="the-project-ideas">The project ideas</h2>

<p>Compared to Google Summer of Code, Outreachy only allows mentors to propose project ideas, rather than candidates. We’ve earmarked three project ideas.</p>

<h3 id="a-built-in-accessibility-checker-for-wagtail">A built-in accessibility checker for Wagtail</h3>

<p>This project is fundamental to meeting our <a href="https://wagtail.org/accessibility/">accessibility commitments</a>. The primary goal is to integrate an existing accessibility test suite within the CMS in a way that takes advantage of the tool’s capabilities and Wagtail’s UI specificities. We envision this being part of Wagtail’s content previews: as the page content changes, authors see what the published page would look like, and get feedback on accessibility issues.</p>

<p>Here is a sneak peak at our first prototype:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/sa11y-prototype.png" alt="Screenshot of a prototype accessibility checker built into Wagtail's live preview" /></p>

<p><em>For more information about this project, to ask questions and provide feedback, follow</em> <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/9262"><em>discussion #9262 Built-in Accessibility Checker</em></a><em> on GitHub.</em></p>

<h3 id="improving-wagtails-editor-guide">Improving Wagtail’s editor guide</h3>

<p>This project follows through <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/google-summer-of-code-wagtail-editor-guide/">Hitansh Shah’s GSoC project</a>, where he created a new site for the Editor Guide documentation, with support from the project mentors. The new site looks fabulous:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/outreachy-welcoming-new-contributors-to-open-source/editor-guide.png" alt="Editor Guide landing page before-after" /></p>

<p>Now the next step is simply to revamp the content! This wasn’t part of Hitansh’s project, and is the perfect follow-up. We’re also very happy to propose a project idea where there is <strong>no need for contributors to know how to code</strong>.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this project, to ask questions and provide feedback, follow <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/guide/discussions/116">discussion #116 Outreachy: Improve user guide documentation for Wagtail</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="stimulus-for-interactive-widgets-in-wagtail">Stimulus for interactive widgets in Wagtail</h3>

<p>Following the leadership of our contributor LB, our UI team has been carefully considering how to bring Wagtail’s JavaScript interactivity to modern standards. This project is the natural follow-up to LB’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/78">RFC #78 for us to adopt Stimulus</a>: rolling it out across large swaths of the user interface.</p>

<p>The RFC is still going through the last stages of validation, so is the best way to follow up or comment on this project!</p>
