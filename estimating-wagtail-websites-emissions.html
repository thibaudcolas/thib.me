<div class="entry-content" data-no-instant><p>Wagtail’s approach to quantifying the carbon footprint of Wagtail websites, so we can reduce it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As Wagtail took off as a project, it became crystal clear it would be popular. Not necessarily as popular as the most established CMS options (yet!), but still powering serious websites on the web. This popularity comes with a responsibility: for us to acknowledge Wagtail websites do have a clear carbon footprint in their operations. Those digital emissions contribute to the climate change impact of the digital world. This acknowledgement is the foundation of <a href="https://wagtail.org/sustainability/">our commitment to sustainability</a>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4">current research</a>, emissions from Information and Communication Technologies represent on the order of 2 to 4% of global emissions (similar to major countries or transportation industries). And they’re projected significantly in the future. Let’s do our best to estimate Wagtail’s footprint within those numbers – so we can reduce it.</p>

<h2 id="our-preferred-methodology">Our preferred methodology</h2>

<p>Due to how carbon emissions originate at all points in the value chain of software, it can be very hard to estimate them accurately. We chose a methodology which makes up for its lack of precision by being very established and simple to apply: the <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/">Sustainable Web Design model</a>. This is the model used by a lot of online calculators, such as <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology clearly specifies two fundamentals decisions when estimating emissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What to measure</strong> – often referred to as “system boundaries” or segments. This can be <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-consumption/">very complex on the web</a>, where the fundamental website visitor experience involves a lot of infrastructure and devices, with different ownership structures.</li>
  <li><strong>How to measure it</strong> – practically, how to compute emissions once the system boundaries are agreed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-boundaries">System boundaries</h3>

<p>Here are the system boundaries as defined by this methodology:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/swd-energy-usage.png" alt="How the Sustainable Web Design model allocates energy usage" /></p>

<p><em>Image credit:</em> <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/explainer/methodologies-for-calculating-website-carbon/"><em>Green Web Foundation, CO2.js</em></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer device use</strong>: end users interacting with a product or service. This accounts for an estimated 52% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Network use</strong>: data transferred across the network. This accounts for an estimated 14% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Data center use</strong>: energy required to house and serve data. This accounts for an estimated 15% of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware production</strong>: embodied energy used in the creation of embedded chips, use of data centers, use of networks, and the use of consumer communication devices. This accounts for an estimated 19% of the system. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="estimation-approach">Estimation approach</h3>

<p>With system boundaries now defined, the model then defines how to measure energy usage (and therefore emissions) with one key metric: data transferred, in kWh/GB. The more data is stored, manipulated, transferred over the network, displayed on a page – the more emissions.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.fershad.com/writing/is-data-the-best-proxy-for-website-carbon-emissions/">clear flaws with this approach</a>: different types of data will be more or less taxing on different parts of the system. It’s nonetheless a good starting approximation because of how simple it is to measure the size of website pages.</p>

<h3 id="more-precise-measurements">More precise measurements</h3>

<p>With the help of the Green Coding Berlin group and the Green Web Foundation, we’ve also been exploring much more precise measurements as part of the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843">Green coding</a> project. With their technology, we can measure detailed power consumption of specific components as a simulated user interacts with the site:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/estimating-wagtail-websites-emissions/green-coding-chart.png" alt="Green coding chart" /></p>

<p>Here, we see how different parts of a website’s infrastructure consume more or less energy as part of specific aspects of serving pages.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those measurements have the potential to allow us to quantify specific improvements to the CMS, therefore improving our ability to influence Wagtail websites’ footprint in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-the-wagtail-web">Measuring the Wagtail web</h2>

<p>To apply our chosen methodology to Wagtail websites, out there, we can use publicly-available data: the Chrome UX Report (CrUX), HTTP Archive, and Wappalyzer. This is the same methodology as devised for the HTTP Archive’s yearly Web Almanac report, which had a <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability">Sustainability chapter</a> for the first time in 2022.</p>

<p>With those datasets of websites’ homepages, as of April 2023, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4349 websites reported as using Wagtail</strong></li>
  <li>For those websites, a <strong>median page weight of 1.9 MB</strong>. This is higher than we’d like but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/page-weight#request-bytes">in line with industry averages</a>.</li>
  <li>Emissions per page visit on the order of 0.5 to 1.5 grams of CO2 equivalent per page view (gCO2e/pageview)</li>
  <li><strong>Average emissions per site around 1.9 tCO2e/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all – <strong>a total of 8240 tons of CO2e/year for all 4349 Wagtail sites</strong>. Though also in line with <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#carbon-emissions">industry average carbon emissions data</a>, this is an uncomfortable figure nonetheless. Which we now have to work to reduce.</p>

<p>Here is what those emissions look like as a tree map, with specific sites or countries sized according to their emissions:</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>Based on this research, we’re hoping to inform future work. We’re soon starting <a href="https://wagtail.org/blog/going-green-with-google-summer-of-code/">Google Summer of Code internships with a green focus</a>, and also hoping to place sustainability improvements <a href="https://wagtail.org/roadmap/">on our roadmap</a> with the view to secure sponsorships from organisations who want to reduce their carbon emissions.</p>
